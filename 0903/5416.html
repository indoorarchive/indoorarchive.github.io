Pikes Peak Ceiling Climb  contest 
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Boys and girls if you have never gone to this contest make it a point sometime     Don Deloach and MMM ran a great contest.   The venue  is the city auditorium  with 37' ceilings in the center and a few lights hanging down.  Folks I here to tell you when you go to a contest and see the event listed on the big bill board out front its going to be a great contest  The flying was good. Started cool in the morning then warmed up nicely in the afternoon. Inside the building the drift and postitoning of the models became more apparent.  There was a sound stage nextdoor and we were serenated several times through out the day.    
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Deloach took us to one of no doubt the coolest resturant ever.  Solos Resturant  by the airport has a KC9 7 attached to the front of the building with the rest of the airplane in the building.  You can eat in the fuselage and there is airplane memorbilia all over the ceilings and walls. The food wasnt bad either.  Very cool atmosphere 
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />  Back to the flying,  certainly grea t to see a large turnout flying models and several juniors flying S/O type planes . I saw several folks walking in from the street no doubt seeing the bill boar d out front and watching the flying.  I, as usual was struggling to get the right combination together for offical F1D flights. We flew till 10 oclock and with the help of John Kagan and Tom Iacbellis I got a couple ok rounds off. My highlight of the contes t is my F1D and Ia cobellis F1D in the air and collide late in the contest. We were the only 2 in the air and both hjad been in the air for  awhile. No damage and after rewinding and launching again I was often talking to Tom's model as it came very close several times to colliding during the flight. I n the morn ing a covey of handlaunch and catapult gliders, several at a time  flying about looking for that ultimate glide. And when it came time for offical flying only the crowd took to their seats and we watched some terrific flying.  
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />If you have never been to or flown  free flight models, whether indoors or outdoors at Colorado Springs  make it a destinatiion.  Again Thanks Don Deloach for your hospitality and contest.

<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />It was a terrific day, with 22 paid flyers. The biggest indoor meet in MMM history (though several regular flyers were not there). 
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Bill Gowen won ULCG with a best flight of 44+ and two 45+ unofficials. This was a really outstanding performance by Bill; it smashed his own site record from 2007. This morning when I drove Bill to the airport I opined that a :45 would probably equal 49-50 seconds at sea level. That would be a .75 to .72 ft/second sink rate! 
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Todd “The Arm” Reynolds won HLG; Romash and “Alfons” won SCLG. Times in these weren’t remarkable (34-36s). 
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Kagan won the F1D regional easily with 2x 18:00+. Romash dominated F1L with a new site record. Romash also won EZB and LPP. Gowen scored another site record in A-6 with 5:39. 
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Grand Champ was really close. Romash pipped Gowen by only one point, 20 to 19.  Gowen barely got second in F1M and did not score any points in SCLG, otherwise he would’ve won. 
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Rgds 
<br />
<br />Don D.
