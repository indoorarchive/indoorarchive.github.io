Some comments to various previous messages on the list....
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; All serious flyers I know still use Tan II, so we don't take pains to 
</em><br />
experiment with something we won't be using in competition any time 
<br />
soon. But
<br />
&nbsp;Tapio L has posted Super Sport energy data a few times. It's often 
<br />
reported that good batches of Super Sport is as good as many or most 
<br />
batches of Tan II, just not as good as the top 3-5 batches of Tan II (of 
<br />
course.)
<br />
<br />Yup. Pic attached. The worst Tan II is about 5% less than the best, the 
<br />
best SS about as bood as worst Tan II, and the worst SS 5% less than the 
<br />
best SS (i.e. 10% less than best Tan II). But the best SS that I have 
<br />
tested was from '04, has not been that good ever since, although the Jan 
<br />
09 batch may be good, concluding from the fact that it was stolen from 
<br />
the hands of mr. Clapp in Max Men, my fellow countryman failed to get a 
<br />
box that he thought was agreed on....
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;&lt;Are newcommers with only current rubber choice at a disadvantage 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compared to Tan II flyers - how much of a disadvantage?&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I'd say that it is less than 10%, as it all boils down to how well you 
<br />
can use the rubber, but also I suspect that the torque curve plays a 
<br />
part. SS has flatter TC, in other words after initial peak it drops 
<br />
more, but the torque is then more constant, which means less variation 
<br />
in the vertical velocity. i think for a fixed-pitch prop and low ceiling 
<br />
this could actually mean an advantage to the model, slower climb to 
<br />
roof. At least my experience with the &quot;less serious&quot; classes has been 
<br />
that e.g. 2006 batch of SS works real good, have not felt a need to try 
<br />
Tan II on those beginner models. Even in contest.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; I fly F1B and test all my motors. I have 2/99, 3/99, 3/02, 10/97 and 
</em><br />
5/99 rubber. Only the 5/99 rubber is better than the last batch of super 
<br />
sport I've tested (6/06). The difference is about 10% as Marc estimated.
<br />
<br />I disagree here, as my graph does.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; If I can infer from the below that your tests show 5/99 is 10% better 
</em><br />
than 3/02 then I think you got hold of a really bad batch of 3/02.
<br />
<br />My graph does not show the standard deviation of energy return between 
<br />
individual motors, but I have not found it to be more than 1 to 2%, in 
<br />
other words, variation within a batch is much less than between batches. 
<br />
Of course, my testing is from one box typically, so if there is a 
<br />
variation between boxes, that I cannot detect, but within a box, it 
<br />
seems that there is no use to test individual motors to select between 
<br />
them; of course it is useful to kow the characteristics of the batch/box...
