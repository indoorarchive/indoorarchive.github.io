2008 USA Team Manager Report
<br />
<br />Most of the US Team got a great opportunity to preview the World
<br />
Champs site by flying in the International Open contest.  In the days
<br />
prior to the world champs the US team and supporters became intimately
<br />
aware of the hazards of the flying site in Belgrade.  John Kagan
<br />
learned early the hazards of the high temperatures on the wound rubber
<br />
bands when he lost a motor stick due to an exploded motor.  And, from
<br />
the very first day, the team realized that it was pointless being at
<br />
the site earlier than about 1:00 pm.  Numerous hours of struggling
<br />
against the low level drift and broken motors made several of team
<br />
members sleep late on the next practice day.  Brett Sanborn should
<br />
have been wiser after seeing a Slovakian plane sucked out one of the
<br />
ceiling vents during the Open contest.  A few days later it happened
<br />
to him.  The vents quickly became one of the most avoided things on
<br />
the ceiling.  Before the contest several people conjectured that the
<br />
disk would be quite friendly and planes would bounce around and come
<br />
down.  This was not the case.  Typically,when a plane would get about
<br />
2-3 feet from the ceiling, it would be sucked toward the roof and
<br />
begin quickly skating across.  
<br />
<br />Round 1 Highlights:
<br />
<br />Jim Richmond showed promise early in the contest with a no touch fight
<br />
of 34:58.  Jim was the first person of the contest to break the
<br />
current world record.  Kagan also had a very promising initial flight.
<br />
&nbsp;His plane flew up into the danger-zone underneath one of the ceiling
<br />
vents and stalled out.  His flight landed dead stick at 34:27; he
<br />
figured the large stall might have cost him a minute or so due to lost
<br />
height and increased prop RPM that burnt off the winds too early. 
<br />
Doug Schaefer, on the other hand, worked on attaining the lowest time
<br />
of the contest after his first round try.  Due to the ground level
<br />
turbulence, Doug's plane stalled out and came down at 1:12.  It's
<br />
flights like these which really test a flier's resolve.  It's tough
<br />
not to get psyched out.  
<br />
<br />The US juniors also had a promising first round showing.  Tim Chang's
<br />
plane was trimmed to peak out at exactly the maximum height of the
<br />
building based on half motors.  This is another trap that a lot of
<br />
people fall into&#x2014;making the half motors go exactly high enough, but
<br />
then do not account for the bonus torque in a full motor and end up on
<br />
the ceiling.  Luckily though after his plane skated across the disk
<br />
and hit the girders on the opposite side, Tim was able to catch the
<br />
plane after a few tries and pull it back to the middle of the floor. 
<br />
His flight landed at about 27 minutes.  Justin Young also had an
<br />
interesting first round that involved steering.  Justin was on the
<br />
ceiling and initially reluctant to steer, but a full circle later the
<br />
plane bumped a girder and was off course&#x2014;a steer was essential to save
<br />
the flight.  Justin caught the plane and released it,  but it still
<br />
needed some repositioning.  While trying to move in with the balloon,
<br />
Justin missed and hit the middle of the fuselage.  Rob Romash was
<br />
watching from a distance said that the tailboom made a 90 degree angle
<br />
to the rest of the plane.  It was miraculous that the plane stayed in
<br />
the air!  At the time the tailboom broke Justin's plane had stopped
<br />
climbing, and afterwards the circled widened, probably to his
<br />
advantage.  His flight landed at 33:27&#x2014;a spectacular time for anyone.
<br />
&nbsp;Things were really looking up for this world champion.
<br />
<br />Though the senior team had a good round, they couldn't relax yet since
<br />
Lutz Schramm did a 36:18 to finish the round&#x2014;everyone was on their toes.
<br />
<br />Round 2 Highlights:
<br />
<br />Jim and Tim both lost second round flights; steering problems lead to
<br />
damaged wings.  Kagan had another good dead stick time of 34:15.  Now
<br />
that John had two good times in for the team score he felt free to &quot;go
<br />
for it&quot; on the rest of his flights.  Defending world champion Larry
<br />
Cailliau showed new promise after a rough first round.  His second
<br />
round flight was a safe, no touch 34:06.  Doug also improved his 1:12
<br />
time with a 32:18.  Justin had another good flight 32:50&#x2014; though this
<br />
one lacked the steering escapades which lead to his high time.
<br />
<br />The heat was turned up again, this time by Ivan Tregar with a
<br />
seemingly ridiculous time of 36:23.
<br />
<br /><br />Round 3 Highlights:
<br />
<br />Tim had a few stalling problems at launch but after a second toss the
<br />
plane took off.  Unfortunately, though, enough torque burned off
<br />
during the first stall to effect the overall flight.  Tim's plane only
<br />
got to about 65' instead of 85-90 and landed with 30:19.  By this time
<br />
Tim's only competition was his own teammate Justin.  Justin decided to
<br />
try a different plane.  The VP on this one was setup a bit
<br />
differently.  The flight profile was such that the plane would climb
<br />
to half altitude then a second climb would take the plane to the
<br />
ceiling after the prop closed.  This turned out to be less efficient
<br />
since the plane landed at around 28 minutes.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
Doug's third round flight did not reach the height that he wanted, but
<br />
the 31:44 was a good backup time to his higher 32 minute flight. 
<br />
Larry Cailliau had a motor explode early in his third round flight. 
<br />
Luckily the model was not damaged badly.  John Kagan had an early mid
<br />
air during his flight&#x2014;just a brush but it put his mind at ease in case
<br />
the flight landed short of the mark.  Three stalls increased his prop
<br />
RPM enough to cause him to dead stick again.  John decided to keep his
<br />
mid air time, though - a wise choice since it was 35:38.  
<br />
<br />Round 4 Highlights:
<br />
<br />Doug Schaefer had a worrisome flight.  Not many people can get away
<br />
with spending 12 minutes of flight time bumping the ceiling.  Luckily
<br />
Doug had plenty of winds which provided a very good time&#x2014;34:24. 
<br />
Doug's plane reached the roof at 8 minutes and finally came off the
<br />
ceiling at 20 minutes.  The majority of people who tried a flight
<br />
profile like that&#x2014;albeit unintentionally&#x2014;ended up plummeting to the
<br />
ground, hanging up, or getting sucked out a ceiling vent.  Kagan had
<br />
rough round due to heavy top level drift.  Forced to steer against the
<br />
ceiling early in flight, John had a tough time keeping the model
<br />
horizontal because of the highly torque motor.  Several right hand
<br />
circles later, a dizzy Kagan released the model.  Unfortunately John
<br />
got turned around and the model was not positioned where he wanted it.
<br />
&nbsp;He steered again, but while trying to release the model he pulled
<br />
down too hard and I saw both wing tips flare up into a V shape.  I let
<br />
out a loud groan thinking a wing spar had broken.  Kagan though&#x2014;ever
<br />
on his game&#x2014;raised the balloon a few inches and the wing popped back
<br />
into shape.  After he released it everyone was amazed to see it still
<br />
in the air.  This seems to be a clear indication of the superiority of
<br />
non-boron wing spars.  John's flight ended up dead sticking again
<br />
probably due to the increased RPM at the ceiling, but still had good
<br />
time on the watch &#x2013;35:15. Cailliau was forced to steer near the
<br />
ceiling on his flight as well.  Like the Kibbie dome, models are
<br />
difficult to see near the white ceiling disk.  Unknowingly, Larry
<br />
moved  the line into the inboard wing tip and put a large slash in the
<br />
film and broke the tip.  This greatly increased the drag on the
<br />
airplane and it landed at 29:33; there is no way of knowing how much
<br />
time the plane would have done without the damage.  Justin had another
<br />
good flight of 32:14, but the time was not good enough to improve his
<br />
backup time.  Justin showed fine form successfully steering his model
<br />
just a few feet beneath the roof.  Tim Chang and Jim Richmond had
<br />
difficult rounds again.  Tim stalled out twice, using both attempts. 
<br />
Jim had problems at the ceiling and the flight ended early.
<br />
<br />Round 5 Highlights:
<br />
<br />Rounds five and six were bound to be the most difficult due their
<br />
placement in the schedule.  Since the rounds started at 10:30 AM
<br />
instead of  the afternoon it was the general strategy of the US team
<br />
to fly as late as possible to get in the best air of the day.  
<br />
<br />By the end of the second day the US team was in second place.  It was
<br />
up to Jim to put in a flight of at least 23 minutes &#x2013; child's play. 
<br />
However, throughout the earlier rounds when Jim would attempt to steer
<br />
he would lose the flight due to difficulty in seeing the plane and
<br />
balloon.  The US Team requested that Jim be allowed a proxy steerer,
<br />
and thanks to decisive action by the FAI Jury, the request was
<br />
granted.  Although he was nervous, John did a fine job negotiating
<br />
Jim's model around the building hazards and other models on both 5th
<br />
and 6th round flights.  Jim pulled off an excellent flight of 33:10 to
<br />
secure team gold for the United States.  Tim Chang worked out his
<br />
stick-bow and launch problems.  A good solid launch lead to a safe, no
<br />
touch flight of 30:40.  
<br />
<br />John went first in the 5th round and found out the hard way not to
<br />
wind and launch in direct sunlight.  After breaking around five motors
<br />
John launched his plane.  He later drifted to the side and needed to
<br />
steer.  A few minutes later in the flight Kagan was forced to steer
<br />
again.  Just as John parked the balloon to let the model run it, the
<br />
rubber motor exploded violently sending the plane into a glide.  The
<br />
flight terminated when the middle rib of John's wing floated to the
<br />
floor.  After the plane landed, John listed off about 8 things that
<br />
had broken or popped loose due to the motor.  For most people this
<br />
would be a devastating occurrence that would ruin their day.  But
<br />
before lunch, Kagan reported that he had fixed all the problems and
<br />
planned to fly the same plane in the last round.  Remarkable.  
<br />
<br />Round 6 Highlights:
<br />
<br />Since the US tried to launch as late as possible in the rounds the
<br />
logistics of round six were tough.  
<br />
<br />Because John was Jim's proxy steerer John was busy with Jim's plane
<br />
until very late in the flight.  Jim's prop folded too late to bring
<br />
down the rest of the competition.  The flight was still quite long for
<br />
how late the prop folded&#x2014;32:42.  Since John was in a position to
<br />
potentially move up in the final rankings he flew last.  By the time
<br />
Jim's plane landed, John had only 20 minutes to process, wind, and
<br />
launch his plane&#x2014;not that any one of these tasks is particularly time
<br />
consuming, but the travel time adds up.  Though John's plane got up
<br />
high enough to do the time, it landed with turns and only 34:01 on the
<br />
clock.  This was probably due to all the parts that broke from the
<br />
exploded motor and possibly the air in the building&#x2014;people began going
<br />
in and out which probably caused more low level drift. 
<br />
<br />After a few days full of launch problems, Tim finally got a fully
<br />
torqued flight up.  Though his plane had a nice slow climb it quickly
<br />
got sucked up against the disk.  Tim's plane skated across in just one
<br />
or two circles.  Usually when planes went across the disk and into
<br />
girder territory they bumped a few times.  Tim was quite unlucky;
<br />
after just one pass under the girders the plane hung up on a
<br />
low-hanging wire. 
<br />
<br />Thank you to:-
<br />
<br />Ray Harlan &#x2013; Ray's balloons were a godsend for this contest.  All
<br />
members of the US team used his balloons.  One major advantage was
<br />
that the Mylar was a little tougher and held up better against the
<br />
rough concrete ceiling and girders than a rubber balloon would have
<br />
been.  By watching our European counterparts we learned that Mylar
<br />
balloons must be handled with care.  Plus, Mylar balloons seemed to be
<br />
&quot;in-style;&quot; everyone had them.
<br />
<br />Also thank you to Phil Sullivan and the NFFS, Tim Goldstein, and the
<br />
Oakland Cloud Dusters for their generous contributions to the team.  
<br />
<br />The event organizers did a fine job running the contest.  Though the
<br />
US team was concerned after the perils of the Open International
<br />
contest, the championships was truly a world class event.  
<br />
<br />US Senior Team manager Rob Romash also made a major contribution to
<br />
the team.  Realizing the need for at-hand scissors, Zap CA glue, Zip
<br />
Kicker, and tweezers, Romash created a device he called &quot;the caddy.&quot; 
<br />
Brown leather epoxied to styrene outfitted with a belt clip served as
<br />
a holster for the essentials of launching an F1D.  The items in the
<br />
caddy were not only used to aid the US fliers; one Czech Junior had a
<br />
motor break and scissors were needed to snip the motor.  Quick on the
<br />
draw, Brett Sanborn rushed over and snipped the motor.  After that,
<br />
the caddy was dubbed &quot;the common denominator of F1D.&quot;
<br />
<br />-	Brett Sanborn and Rob Romash,
<br />
