<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2008 USA Team Manager Report
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Most of the US Team got a great opportunity to preview the World
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Champs site by flying in the International Open contest.  In the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; days
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prior to the world champs the US team and supporters became 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intimately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aware of the hazards of the flying site in Belgrade.  John Kagan
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; learned early the hazards of the high temperatures on the wound 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rubber
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bands when he lost a motor stick due to an exploded motor.  And, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the very first day, the team realized that it was pointless being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the site earlier than about 1:00 pm.  Numerous hours of struggling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against the low level drift and broken motors made several of team
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; members sleep late on the next practice day.  Brett Sanborn should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have been wiser after seeing a Slovakian plane sucked out one of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ceiling vents during the Open contest.  A few days later it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happened
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to him.  The vents quickly became one of the most avoided things on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the ceiling.  Before the contest several people conjectured that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disk would be quite friendly and planes would bounce around and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; down.  This was not the case.  Typically,when a plane would get 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2-3 feet from the ceiling, it would be sucked toward the roof and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; begin quickly skating across.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Round 1 Highlights:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jim Richmond showed promise early in the contest with a no touch 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fight
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of 34:58.  Jim was the first person of the contest to break the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current world record.  Kagan also had a very promising initial 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flight.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  His plane flew up into the danger-zone underneath one of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ceiling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vents and stalled out.  His flight landed dead stick at 34:27; he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; figured the large stall might have cost him a minute or so due to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lost
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; height and increased prop RPM that burnt off the winds too early. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Doug Schaefer, on the other hand, worked on attaining the lowest 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the contest after his first round try.  Due to the ground level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; turbulence, Doug's plane stalled out and came down at 1:12.  It's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flights like these which really test a flier's resolve.  It's tough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not to get psyched out.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The US juniors also had a promising first round showing.  Tim 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chang's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plane was trimmed to peak out at exactly the maximum height of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; building based on half motors.  This is another trap that a lot of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people fall into&#x2014;making the half motors go exactly high enough, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then do not account for the bonus torque in a full motor and end up 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the ceiling.  Luckily though after his plane skated across the disk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and hit the girders on the opposite side, Tim was able to catch the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plane after a few tries and pull it back to the middle of the floor. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; His flight landed at about 27 minutes.  Justin Young also had an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting first round that involved steering.  Justin was on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ceiling and initially reluctant to steer, but a full circle later 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plane bumped a girder and was off course&#x2014;a steer was essential to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; save
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the flight.  Justin caught the plane and released it,  but it still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; needed some repositioning.  While trying to move in with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; balloon,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Justin missed and hit the middle of the fuselage.  Rob Romash was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; watching from a distance said that the tailboom made a 90 degree 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; angle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the rest of the plane.  It was miraculous that the plane stayed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the air!  At the time the tailboom broke Justin's plane had stopped
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; climbing, and afterwards the circled widened, probably to his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; advantage.  His flight landed at 33:27&#x2014;a spectacular time for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anyone.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Things were really looking up for this world champion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Though the senior team had a good round, they couldn't relax yet 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lutz Schramm did a 36:18 to finish the round&#x2014;everyone was on their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; toes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Round 2 Highlights:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jim and Tim both lost second round flights; steering problems lead 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; damaged wings.  Kagan had another good dead stick time of 34:15.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that John had two good times in for the team score he felt free to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for it&quot; on the rest of his flights.  Defending world champion Larry
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cailliau showed new promise after a rough first round.  His second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; round flight was a safe, no touch 34:06.  Doug also improved his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1:12
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time with a 32:18.  Justin had another good flight 32:50&#x2014; though 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one lacked the steering escapades which lead to his high time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The heat was turned up again, this time by Ivan Tregar with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seemingly ridiculous time of 36:23.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Round 3 Highlights:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tim had a few stalling problems at launch but after a second toss 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plane took off.  Unfortunately, though, enough torque burned off
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; during the first stall to effect the overall flight.  Tim's plane 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; got to about 65' instead of 85-90 and landed with 30:19.  By this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tim's only competition was his own teammate Justin.  Justin decided 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; try a different plane.  The VP on this one was setup a bit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differently.  The flight profile was such that the plane would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; climb
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to half altitude then a second climb would take the plane to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ceiling after the prop closed.  This turned out to be less 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; efficient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since the plane landed at around 28 minutes.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Doug's third round flight did not reach the height that he wanted, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 31:44 was a good backup time to his higher 32 minute flight. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Larry Cailliau had a motor explode early in his third round flight. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Luckily the model was not damaged badly.  John Kagan had an early 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; air during his flight&#x2014;just a brush but it put his mind at ease in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the flight landed short of the mark.  Three stalls increased his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prop
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RPM enough to cause him to dead stick again.  John decided to keep 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mid air time, though - a wise choice since it was 35:38.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Round 4 Highlights:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Doug Schaefer had a worrisome flight.  Not many people can get away
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with spending 12 minutes of flight time bumping the ceiling.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Luckily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Doug had plenty of winds which provided a very good time&#x2014;34:24. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Doug's plane reached the roof at 8 minutes and finally came off the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ceiling at 20 minutes.  The majority of people who tried a flight
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; profile like that&#x2014;albeit unintentionally&#x2014;ended up plummeting to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ground, hanging up, or getting sucked out a ceiling vent.  Kagan 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rough round due to heavy top level drift.  Forced to steer against 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ceiling early in flight, John had a tough time keeping the model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; horizontal because of the highly torque motor.  Several right hand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; circles later, a dizzy Kagan released the model.  Unfortunately 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; John
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; got turned around and the model was not positioned where he wanted 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  He steered again, but while trying to release the model he pulled
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; down too hard and I saw both wing tips flare up into a V shape.  I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; let
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out a loud groan thinking a wing spar had broken.  Kagan 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though&#x2014;ever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on his game&#x2014;raised the balloon a few inches and the wing popped 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; back
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into shape.  After he released it everyone was amazed to see it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the air.  This seems to be a clear indication of the superiority 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-boron wing spars.  John's flight ended up dead sticking again
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably due to the increased RPM at the ceiling, but still had 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time on the watch &#x2013;35:15. Cailliau was forced to steer near the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ceiling on his flight as well.  Like the Kibbie dome, models are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficult to see near the white ceiling disk.  Unknowingly, Larry
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moved  the line into the inboard wing tip and put a large slash in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; film and broke the tip.  This greatly increased the drag on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; airplane and it landed at 29:33; there is no way of knowing how 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time the plane would have done without the damage.  Justin had 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good flight of 32:14, but the time was not good enough to improve 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; backup time.  Justin showed fine form successfully steering his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just a few feet beneath the roof.  Tim Chang and Jim Richmond had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficult rounds again.  Tim stalled out twice, using both attempts. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jim had problems at the ceiling and the flight ended early.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Round 5 Highlights:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rounds five and six were bound to be the most difficult due their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; placement in the schedule.  Since the rounds started at 10:30 AM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instead of  the afternoon it was the general strategy of the US 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; team
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to fly as late as possible to get in the best air of the day.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By the end of the second day the US team was in second place.  It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up to Jim to put in a flight of at least 23 minutes &#x2013; child's play. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, throughout the earlier rounds when Jim would attempt to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; steer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he would lose the flight due to difficulty in seeing the plane and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; balloon.  The US Team requested that Jim be allowed a proxy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; steerer,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and thanks to decisive action by the FAI Jury, the request was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; granted.  Although he was nervous, John did a fine job negotiating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jim's model around the building hazards and other models on both 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5th
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and 6th round flights.  Jim pulled off an excellent flight of 33:10 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; secure team gold for the United States.  Tim Chang worked out his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stick-bow and launch problems.  A good solid launch lead to a safe, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; touch flight of 30:40.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; John went first in the 5th round and found out the hard way not to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wind and launch in direct sunlight.  After breaking around five 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; motors
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; John launched his plane.  He later drifted to the side and needed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; steer.  A few minutes later in the flight Kagan was forced to steer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again.  Just as John parked the balloon to let the model run it, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rubber motor exploded violently sending the plane into a glide.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flight terminated when the middle rib of John's wing floated to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; floor.  After the plane landed, John listed off about 8 things that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had broken or popped loose due to the motor.  For most people this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be a devastating occurrence that would ruin their day.  But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before lunch, Kagan reported that he had fixed all the problems and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; planned to fly the same plane in the last round.  Remarkable.  
</em><br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Round 6 Highlights:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since the US tried to launch as late as possible in the rounds the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logistics of round six were tough.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because John was Jim's proxy steerer John was busy with Jim's plane
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; until very late in the flight.  Jim's prop folded too late to bring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; down the rest of the competition.  The flight was still quite long 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how late the prop folded&#x2014;32:42.  Since John was in a position to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; potentially move up in the final rankings he flew last.  By the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jim's plane landed, John had only 20 minutes to process, wind, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; launch his plane&#x2014;not that any one of these tasks is particularly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consuming, but the travel time adds up.  Though John's plane got up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; high enough to do the time, it landed with turns and only 34:01 on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clock.  This was probably due to all the parts that broke from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exploded motor and possibly the air in the building&#x2014;people began 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in and out which probably caused more low level drift. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; After a few days full of launch problems, Tim finally got a fully
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; torqued flight up.  Though his plane had a nice slow climb it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quickly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; got sucked up against the disk.  Tim's plane skated across in just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or two circles.  Usually when planes went across the disk and into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; girder territory they bumped a few times.  Tim was quite unlucky;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after just one pass under the girders the plane hung up on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; low-hanging wire. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thank you to:-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ray Harlan &#x2013; Ray's balloons were a godsend for this contest.  All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; members of the US team used his balloons.  One major advantage was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the Mylar was a little tougher and held up better against the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rough concrete ceiling and girders than a rubber balloon would have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been.  By watching our European counterparts we learned that Mylar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; balloons must be handled with care.  Plus, Mylar balloons seemed to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;in-style;&quot; everyone had them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also thank you to Phil Sullivan and the NFFS, Tim Goldstein, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Oakland Cloud Dusters for their generous contributions to the team.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The event organizers did a fine job running the contest.  Though 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; US team was concerned after the perils of the Open International
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contest, the championships was truly a world class event.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; US Senior Team manager Rob Romash also made a major contribution to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the team.  Realizing the need for at-hand scissors, Zap CA glue, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Zip
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kicker, and tweezers, Romash created a device he called &quot;the caddy.&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Brown leather epoxied to styrene outfitted with a belt clip served 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a holster for the essentials of launching an F1D.  The items in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; caddy were not only used to aid the US fliers; one Czech Junior had 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; motor break and scissors were needed to snip the motor.  Quick on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; draw, Brett Sanborn rushed over and snipped the motor.  After that,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the caddy was dubbed &quot;the common denominator of F1D.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -        Brett Sanborn and Rob Romash,
</em><br />
