And I can imagine the guys on the ground thinking, &quot;Yeah, that sign merely describes our supervisor.&quot; An everyday cigarrette is probably the worse danger. (Just guessing.)

<br />Mark,We were using H balloons back in Ukraine before 2000. Nothing blew up. 
<br />
One guy even used to take them outside after competition and pop them with a cigarette.
<br />
I think mylar H ballon would be safe enough - small and low pressure.At 2018 WCh I talked to Ray Harlan about how to make them. Nothing complicated. The only problem - metallized mylar with self-seal layer. Tried several suppliers from China - min order was 100 kg roll.Regards,

 Thanks Jake. I did mean it, saying, &quot;time for me to ditch the 100 grammers.&quot; But was just thinking out loud regarding Kurt's question on the discrepancy between party balloon fill volume vs (more compressed) helium in steering balloon. I'm probably not going to make KD anyhow.
Btw, has anyone experimented with hydrogen? I  know H2 has a bad rap, (&quot;Oh...the humanity!&quot;)  But in India they've been using H2-filled balloons in festivals for decades.  Not without some mishaps, but indoorists dont smoke and get crazy like they do. So far. :^))MB

Mark,
You'll definitely need a smaller 36&quot; balloon at Kibbie.  I can give you one of my spares if you don't have one.  I only have 1 full tank and about 1/3 of another tank.  That combined with higher than usual attendance (close to 30 people) means the helium supply will be limited this year.  I can't allow people to fill oversize or extremely leaky balloons because we just don't have the helium to spare.

 Edit.  It's got to be way more than double the helium for the 100 grammers, since Im comparing to 30 grammers, i think.

 The latex balloons used for steering can compress helium way more (per water volume) than a mylar wall party balloon.  For that matter, those 100g Scientific Sales balloons i have used  (nominally also called 36&quot;, I think) will take (it seems) double or more the helium moles compared with the popular lighter latex balloons,  espcially those final 2 or 3 three inches of diameter to get a manly pull.  Time for me to ditch the 100 gram style.

Hi Tom,
Wow, that would not of been my guess, your numbers show the size difference is 31..8 so that .84 cents for the helium to fill a dollar store balloon.  I am sure the mylar balloon is very inexpensive, so it appears the dollar store isn't losing money, like I originally thought. Thanks for the data on the volume of each balloon. 
Cheers,
Kurt

Kurt,            An 18” foil balloon holds .44 cf of helium vs 14 cf for a 36” latex steering balloon.

     The Dollar Tree in my area is selling mylar balloons which float for a buck, there not as big as a 36&quot; balloon but not 27 times smaller, so  how are they able to do this at the cost of helium these days?
Cheers,
Kurt

So at approximately 14 cubic feet per 36 inch latex balloon. Six balloons per tank.  That’s $27 per balloon if anyone wants a balloon filled.

Just throwing some info out for all. I had my two 80 cubic foot tanks 
refilled after the Kent contest (actually its a bottle swap not a 
&quot;refill&quot;). It was $167 a bottle and took 2 weeks to get.  They had to be 
ordered but at least I was able to get some. I recall the $32 refills 
when I first got the tank, then was about $50-$60 for many year until 
the recent helium shortage and then went up to $115 (about 2 years ago) 
and now $167. Hydrogen filled steering balloons anyone? :-)
