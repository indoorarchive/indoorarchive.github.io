On Saturday, John Kagan, Rob Romash, Yuan Kang Lee, Victor, Tom I, Max Z, Dan, Ben Saks, and Phil Kibbie flew at Lakehurst.  Actually, Max didn't fly but came to provide moral support(?).
<br />
<br />On Sunday, it was only Kagan, Romash, and Lee.
<br />
<br />Tom had built a new LPP with Phil Kibbie, the FLOAT cinematographer, and was test flying it.  A LPP contest ensued between Tom and Rob.  Both flew in the 15's but I don't know who won the money.
<br />
<br />Tom, Rob, can you post your flight and contest results?
<br />
<br />Tom also brought a beautiful, classically shaped 35cm with a braced microfilm wing.  It glowed in the afternoon sunlight, and I think I'm still infatuated with it.
<br />
<br />John had brought his big stick Safat but decided to fly the small stick. The Safat stayed in the box.  Wouldn't it have been nice if Max brought his HLS and both of them flew?  What could have been.  Instead, John's EZB flew to 29+ on Saturday and 32+ on Sunday.
<br />
<br />Rob brought all of his toys, including his nose soaring hang glider.  One big regret for me: not filming how &quot;cool&quot; he looked while the glider soared on his nose.  His Poonker EVO II and EVO III ministicks are beautiful in the box and in the air.  The EVOs have a 3rd, middle, rudder under the stab.  They launched and climbed beautifully.  No ministick funny business.
<br />
<br />Dan flew his two EZBs.  They are very cool looking with twin ruddered stab and a wing with center dihedral.
<br />
<br />Ben flew his F1L and helicopter.  The F1L looked like it had trouble with stall at launch.  Ben, please update us with how your models flew.
<br />
<br />Victor flew his ancient LPP.  I don't know why he didn't fly his newer EZB.  One was a Banks LPP.  I don't recall the other.  Victor, how did your LPPs fly?
<br />
<br />I saw Phil launch his new LPP once.  All the other times, Tom was playing with it.
<br />
<br />Max looked like he had a good time listening to his iPod, eating his deli sandwich, and drinking something from a paper bag.
<br />
<br />I flew my EZB on Saturday to 26 and finally hit 30 on Sunday.  I also had a F1L dual with Romash.  Romash bested me on his 4th attempt, flying to a 21:40 and smashed my 19:20.  I later made another F1L flight but came up short at 20:40.
<br />
<br />One highlight was my late evening launch.  The last launch I made was Sunday night at 10:23 pm, in an attempt to better my 30 minute flight. It must have been bad air because I came up short at 29:06.  This flight was launched with no one else in the hanger, other than the Lakehurst ghost dog, who howled as he saw the EZB rocket through the still night.  It was not easy to track the model by myself for 30 minutes, and I woke up the next morning with a very stiff neck.
<br />
<br />Everyone else who was there -- please update us with your observations.
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
<br />-Kang
