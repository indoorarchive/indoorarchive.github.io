Labor Day weekend did not bring good conditions to Hanger #1.  Saturday was an awful day.  Sunday was a bad day.  But Monday was at least flyable, and there were many planes near the rafters.
<br />
<br />Tom Iacobellis flew his open Penny Plane to 20+.  The flight was marked by repeated bumps in the rafters.  It also performed two torque rolls (counter clockwise) at launch.  Spectacular flight overall.
<br />
<br />The Monday LPP battle saw Max, Leo, and Bill duking it out.  Leo flew his to 16:05.  Max flew to about 16:20.  Bill flew about 17:25.  All three were great flying planes.
<br />
<br />Jim Richmond damaged his HLS on a steer shortly after launch on Sunday. Jim flew his funky F1L on Monday.  I love the way it climbs -- steep spiral climb with super slow RPM.  Before the good climb, however, the plane reacted to too much torque, turned right and headed for the side wall.  Jim recovered it at about 50' and brought it down.
<br />
<br />Bill landed his #1 LPP on top of the blue canvas structure Sunday.  With Max's pole, he was able to bump it down from below and recover it without damage on Monday.  His 17+ flight was made with LPP #2.
<br />
<br />I flew my light EZBs but could not get them to climb.  The prop flared too much on launch torque and could only climb too 100' and record a 24:05.
<br />
<br />Steve (from DC) flew partial motor flights with his F1L and LPP.  He left Sunday and did not see good flying conditions.
<br />
<br />Nick Ray flew partial motor flights on his new 35 cm.  It was damaged when the motor broke just before launch.
<br />
<br />Tony D'Allessandro damaged his HLS on Saturday.  He also flew his AROG.
<br />
<br />Also present was Carl Van Buren.  Carl flew partial motor on his LPP on Saturday.
<br />
<br />Jeff Hood came on Saturday and took lots of pictures.
<br />
<br />Jeff, let us know when the pictures will be uploaded to Picasa.
<br />
<br />For me, the next Lakehurst trip will be in mid summer when the days are longer and the chance of hurricane is small.
<br />
<br />If I missed or erred on anything, please follow up and post.
<br />
