<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, then, &quot;Major League Baseball&quot; is also &quot;what we make of it&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Obviously.  Major League Baseball is only &quot;major&quot; because we attend the games in large numbers.  The huge player contracts, big stadiums, top advertising, container ships of bobble-head dolls &#x2013; are all because the fans buy lots of tickets.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the sandlot game down the street is legitimately labeled &quot;major.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />If the sandlot game down the street happens to be skateboarding and BMX bikes, then yes, is it now &quot;major&quot; because we attend the X-Games in large numbers.
<br />
<br />In both cases &quot;major&quot; is what we make it.  The promoters would like it to be major.  We make it major (or not).
<br />
<br />From another angle: if someone is trying to host an event that requires a certain relatively large number of participants to break even, then it only makes sense that it be promoted as a major event and scheduled so as not to conflict with other major events.
<br />
<br />The person with the daunting task of trying to host a big contest for the benefit of the Indoor community had better treat it as big.  Calling it &quot;major&quot; doesn't guarantee a large turnout, but calling it &quot;small&quot; goes a long way toward making sure it is small.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Major event&quot; ought to at least mean &quot;used&quot; before, if not also mean, &quot;recognized by those concerned with this sort of event.&quot;  Also should imply  &quot;Reasonably well attended by those concerned with such.&quot;  Of course, it's all relative, and hyperbole has its place.  For example, USIC is a &quot;major&quot; indoor contest.  This not to suggest that non-major contests ought not be supported and advertised, and enjoyed.   By all mean, please announce here, just tell the truth, please.
</em><br />
<br />By that definition there would be no &quot;major events&quot;, since all sites are unused, unrecognized, and not well-attended first.  Kind of a reverse chicken and egg situation.
<br />
<br />It would be great if all flying sites could be tested out and proven by a small group before they were offered up to the rest of us, but that's not always possible due to cost, etc.  I suspect that may be the case here.
<br />
<br />Interestingly, Don was talking about the PPCC, not the Springerville event.  That was just mentioned as something he was scheduling around.
<br />
<br />So, I'd suggest that it would be more constructive to ask, &quot;hey, what's this Springerville event that someone is going through the effort to host for us?&quot; than get irritated that the term &quot;major&quot; doesn't meet your personal definition (which doesn't match the dictionary def).  It's hard enough to get participants.  Just sayin'
