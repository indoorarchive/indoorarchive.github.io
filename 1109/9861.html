Aki,
<br />
Thanks for the story behind the winning times. When ever I read the winning times posted by an accomplished flyer such as yourself, I naively always assume they encountered no difficulties in achieving their win. So, thanks for letting us understand that it is not always easy &amp; perseverance pays!  Besides it was a very interesting story &amp; your English is fine. Congratulations.
<br />
Gary Hodson

<br />Thanks, Ree san, Bob san and Tim san.
<br />
It was a very difficult contest for me. I had 3 models there.
<br />
1st round:
<br />
It was a lucky round for me. There was drift air in the dome. So, I launched 
<br />
my 1st model near the wall. My model climbed along by the dome wall, and 
<br />
cruised near the ceiling, and descended along by the other end of dome wall, 
<br />
and then landed at 31mins+.
<br />
2nd round:
<br />
When launching, my model went straight to the wall because the rear end of a 
<br />
prop shaft was off from the bearing. Ended 1 min+ because I could not steer 
<br />
and stop my model.
<br />
After this round, when removing the rubber, the rubber broken and the motor 
<br />
stick was destroyed... Lost 1st model.
<br />
3rd round:
<br />
Switched to 2nd model. But....the model was caught in the ceiling structure 
<br />
at 8 mins+. Lost 2nd model.
<br />
4th round:
<br />
When assembling my 3rd model, I broke 3 ribs and front wing post and tore 
<br />
the wing film !! Lost all 3 models... NoNo, I had to repair the model to win 
<br />
the contest. It was a difficult work for me to repair the model in dim light 
<br />
dome. I could manage to repair my 3rd model. The front post was only CyAed 
<br />
and the 2 boron were not replaced.
<br />
It was lucky that the 3rd model flew OK, though not best, and did 30+ at 4th 
<br />
round, 31+ at 5&amp;6th rounds.
<br />
<br />Excuse my terrible English, Aki
