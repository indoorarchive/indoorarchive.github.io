&nbsp;&quot;...However, the proposers and supporters of the rule change used the FAI procedures, the politics of the times, and their European location and familiarity with the process and people to succeed in getting the rule changes passed.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Exactly my point.  The CIAM process was followed, but that process does not adequately represent the people who actually fly the models.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&quot;...I am not pleased that the public process started while many top F1D fliers were busy preparing for the 2014 Indoor WC&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I'd argue that there was no legitimate public process at all.  Word of the proposal trickled out, and a few of the CIAM representatives were contacted.  This is a far cry from systematically collecting knowledgeable input from the people who know the activity the best.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;The process won't change unless we, the people who are supposedly being represented, protest with a loud enough voice.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I have asked the US CIAM representative to provide a list of votes so that we can analyze how this proposal was passed.  If the representatives in favor of the proposal had valid input from their F1D flying constituents, then I'm fine with accepting the results.  However, if they did not, I believe there exists a legitimate objection regarding our representation.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;There is a similar situation in the US with the election of local judges.  People receive a lot of information about the major candidates in an election, but when they get to the polls they are also presented with a list of judicial candidates that most people know nothing about.  Apparently most people choose by name recognition as a last resort.  In my county there are 3 Corrigan's, 5 Gallagher's, and 6 Russo's.  As a result of the guessing game, we have some pretty bad judges (based on bar association and newspaper ratings).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;To combat this problem, a website called judge4yourself.com was created so that people could make a knowledgeable choice rather than guessing.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;We need something similar for the CIAM reps who are voting on issues related to our F1D.
<br />
