Thanks, everyone, for your good wishes.  I put some thoughts together for the NFFS blog: 
<br />
&nbsp;I am extremely happy to have been part of the 2014 United States F1D World Championship team.  We set a new high mark for team scoring (by almost 10 minutes!) and exceeded what we thought was achievable.  This was against the backdrop of competing against a high-flying Romanian team that had thoroughly trounced us in the Otto Hints contest.   The pressure was on, we dug deep, and we delivered. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Brett Sanborn was completely in tune with his models.  By most measures, he was the best flier at this world championship.  He was able to consistently launch his model to catwalk height, starting in round 1.  While I was chasing the leaders throughout the contest, his top performance was an inspiration to me as I continued searching for improvements.  Brett was always ready to fly, and save for the last round, he led off each round.  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;John Kagan made it count when it mattered the most -- scoring his two highest times in the final two flights.  His advice on all aspects of flying in the Mine and in the championship was of tremendous help.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Tom Sova was a reassuring presence throughout our trip, especially out on the flying floor as we prepared for launch.  I am especially happy to have had Tom with me in this world championship as he was my &quot;Pro&quot; partner in the LPP Pro/Am in my first USIC in 2010.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I want to thank Aurel Popa for being such a great host.  He welcomed us with warmth and open arms and made us feel like family.  His daily servings of tea and tuica warmed our bodies and spirits.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I loved the Mine from the moment I first set my foot in it to 8 days later when I left.  The chill of 50F temperature did nothing to dampen my enthusiasm and spirit.   Long underwear, a thick outer coat, and a wool hat kept me warm throughout.  My hands were never cold, and I never wore gloves.  The hand warmers I brought stayed unopened.   Spring conditions kept the humidity low, and my models did not warp in any way.  The dry air also contributed greatly to our comfort.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;The flying conditions were consistently good throughout the contest.   The air was calm, and the drift was low.  Flying conditions were fair to the competitors.  There was no better time to fly than &quot;now&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Our accommodations at the Baia Rosie hotel was top notch.  We slept well, and we ate like kings.  What more can you ask for?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I focused on the basics of indoor flying -- trim, rubber, and altitude control.  I saw Treger and Schramm dedicate a lot of time trimming and test flying.  I tried to keep a cool head and put little pressure on myself.  My conservative flights in the first 3 rounds gave me room fly more aggressively in the last rounds.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;My best flights required no steers.  On 3 flights that went above the catwalk, the Mine exuded an aura of protection and kept the model centered.   Yes, I felt the spirit of the Mine.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I hope to return to the Mine very soon.
<br />

<br />
