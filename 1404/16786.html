More rules and more restriction is never the way to go. An argument an 
<br />
be made for any aspect of the model that should be regulated for 
<br />
&quot;fairness&quot;  or &quot;equaling the playing field&quot; be it rubber, VP props, 
<br />
covering, balsa wood quality, who has access to more places to test fly 
<br />
than another, eye vision, hand eye coordination, winding abilty, etc.... 
<br />
Less rules is what is needed not adding more. All this talk about Y2K2 
<br />
but indoor FF existed just fine before any plastic covering was ever 
<br />
used on indoor models. When Y2K2 came around I proposed lifting covering 
<br />
restriction on events like EZB, and Int Stick as my reasoning was that 
<br />
the covering weights were similar and what will happen when Y2K2 runs 
<br />
out then those who have it will have an advantage, so by allowing 
<br />
microfilm to be used you would not be at a weight penalty at all and 
<br />
microfilm is much cheaper than Y2K2. My approach was not to ban Y2K2 but 
<br />
allow other covering choices in those events so more freedom of choice. 
<br />
It was voted down. Now there was a vote taken on Y2K2 by the Indoor 
<br />
board as to if it was considered &quot;commercially&quot; available since it was 
<br />
an experimental roll of film and some AMA events require the covering to 
<br />
be commercially available.  At the time there was suppose to be another 
<br />
bulk roll of the film so it was allowed as another roll was in surplus 
<br />
but it seems after several years it was thrown out so the promise of 
<br />
lots of future Y2K2 went down the drain and that is when the trouble 
<br />
started in availability.  Personally I fail to see how trying to ban 
<br />
Y2K2 being meaningful in any way on a 1.2 gram model or the upcoming 1.4 
<br />
gram version on the basis of it giving a competitive edge.  I do not 
<br />
want to sound like a broken record but 65cm models were much bigger and 
<br />
longer and were 1 gram and flew on much heavier rubber, I used 14&quot; loops 
<br />
weighing 1.4 grams and launched at torques up to .7 in oz on 14&quot; motor 
<br />
sticks. Going form 9&quot; chord to 7.8&quot; and span from 65 down to 55cm and 
<br />
increasing the weight  from 1.0 to 1.2 gram and much smaller cross 
<br />
section rubber made the models much easier to build to weight with 
<br />
either plastic or microfilm, the two I build for USIC 2013 were ~1.1 
<br />
grams with VP and I had to ballast up. So I am having trouble 
<br />
understanding all the posts about how a few mg covering difference from 
<br />
Y2K to OS film is of such significance on a model that weighs 
<br />
comparatively so much to its predecessor, even more so with the upcoming 
<br />
1.4 gram weight. The way I see it now, to get a model to balance with a 
<br />
7&quot; stick under the new 1.4 gram rules you probably need a microfilm 
<br />
covered wing, and a Polymicro covered stab to get the CG back far enough!
