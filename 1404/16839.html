Don,
<br />
<br />I think you are overstating things.  I believe the CIAM adhere to the laid down procedures but that National bodies, from the top to ‘grass roots’ level do not take sufficient interest in what is going on and therefore fail to make proper representation at the right time.  It is an interesting fact about rule making that if a proposed change is put before the leading flyers of the class concerned then almost all of them will vote against change.  Often because they believe they will lose the advantage of knowledge gained from experience.  In practice a rule change usually causes a few fliers to change to a different class but the majority see the rule change as a challenge which they soon meet and remain as leaders in the discipline.
<br />
<br />John

<br />Semantics.

<br />
<br />There's obviously a sizable majority of F1D flyers who are unhappy with this rule change, which seems to have been introduced at the eleventh hour, intentionally, with little debate.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />This episode has certainly dealt a serious blow to the credibility of CIAM and its processes. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Am I overstating?

<br />LeoP has described the CIAM voting procedure and usual practice correctly.
<br />
<br />In case of a vote on a proposal, only the number of votes are registered, the countries not, that concerns for the TMs as well. At the FFTM, after discussion, finally there was a 7:3 majority vote for the proposal. (During the discussion there was a test vote on a supposed proposal variant not adding the 0.2 g weight to the model, it has got 9:1 support, but as there was no such proposal on the table, the final voting happened on the original one.) 
<br />
<br />Having majority vote on the proposal, it was recommended at the Plenary. I noted 22 votes for the proposal, 8 against (someone else noted 6), so 30 or 28 countries voted. As 40 countries were represented, 10 or 12 not voted, which is possible and recommended if the country is not interested or involved in the particular class.

<br /><br /><br />Aurel and others,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I emailed Ian Kaynes, the chair of the Free Flight Technical committee, to ask about the vote detail for the Free Flight Technical committee (7 to 3 in favor) as the FFT Committee vote was to make a favorable recommendation for the F1D rule change to the CIAM Plenary.  Ian Kaynes emailed back that he did not record the countries voting for or against as this was time consuming and only the vote numbers were needed.  I replied asking that if he had any recollection of the three countries voting against the rule change or how the countries voted in the Plenary meeting, could he please email back with such recollections. I have not yet received a reply to that question so I suspect he does not have such recollections. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Andras Ree was at the Free Flight Technical meeting. Perhaps he can fill us in on the vote detail for the Free Flight Technical Committee meeting and the Plenary meeting that followed.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Please note that of the ten countries represented at the FFTM, six countries had entrants in the recent 2014 Indoor World Championships at Slanic.  At least three of those countries must have voted in favor of the F1D rules changes.  Also note that the technical representatives to the FFT Committee have no obligation, as explicitly stated in the FAI Sporting Regulations, to vote as instructed by their National Aeromodeling Committee.  These experts are allowed to vote as their expertise directs them.  The recommendations of the FFT Committee have great weight with the CIAM Plenary. Ian Kaynes has informed me that if the vote in the FFTM is unanimous, the Plenary usually follows the FFT Committee's  votes without a formal vote of the Plenary.
