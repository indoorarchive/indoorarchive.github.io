John,
<br />
<br />&quot;Nick,  I'm not following your argument.  Are you just making stuff up?&quot;
<br />
<br />I chose &quot;If&quot; very carefully. Kirda said a rule that required the model to
<br />
be constructed from all commercially available materials would eventually
<br />
ban materials like Harlan bearings and wood. I like Harlan bearings, but I
<br />
fully agree that there are other alternatives. My point was that its
<br />
reasonable to say that the model has to be built from still purchasable
<br />
materials. If something is truly critical someone will find an alternative,
<br />
like OS film was to Y2K(2).
<br />
<br />&quot;Y2K2 isn't required either.  I haven't used Y2K2 or Y2K since the early
<br />
2000's, my planes are down to weight, have all the latest gadgets, and have
<br />
achieved reasonable success.&quot;
<br />
<br />I just did 35minutes under 90' with an OS film covered model that
<br />
required ballast. I completely agree with you. Yet a whole room full
<br />
of brilliant people agreed that we should change the F1D rules because Y2K2
<br />
wasn't available anymore. I think this reasoning is a non-sequitor, but it
<br />
may stem from a feeling that something isn't fair with the current rules.
<br />
So I'm asking the question, is there a way to give legitimacy to this
<br />
feeling by changing the rules in a way that actually addresses the concern.
<br />
<br />&quot;What alternate reality are you living in?  Didn't you just benefit from a
<br />
program that supplies 5/99 to people who need it?  I don't see the
<br />
situation you are describing.&quot;
<br />
<br />You are absolutely right, I am very fortunate to be part of the strongest
<br />
F1D program in the world. Even when disaster struck me personally, my
<br />
country helped me get back on my feet. What would I do if were from another
<br />
country? Our program is so strong that we have won better than half of all
<br />
World Championships. Now imagine you are from a small country without film
<br />
or rubber, wouldn't you want to change the rules so didn't have to compete
<br />
against us from a materials standpoint? The F1D rule change has very little
<br />
to do with wants of American program participants. There were 12 countries
<br />
at the last World Champs. 30 countries voted 8/22 on the rule change,
<br />
presumably because they could empathize with the under resourced, trying to
<br />
compete against powerhouse programs like ours.
<br />
<br />So I ask again, what would a F1D utopia look like?
<br />
<br />Nick

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; More rules and more restriction is never the way to go. An argument an be

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made for any aspect of the model that should be regulated for &quot;fairness&quot;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or &quot;equaling the playing field&quot; be it rubber, VP props, covering, balsa

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wood quality, who has access to more places to test fly than another, eye
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vision, hand eye coordination, winding abilty, etc.... Less rules is what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is needed not adding more. All this talk about Y2K2 but indoor FF existed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just fine before any plastic covering was ever used on indoor models. When
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Y2K2 came around I proposed lifting covering restriction on events like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; EZB, and Int Stick as my reasoning was that the covering weights were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar and what will happen when Y2K2 runs out then those who have it will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have an advantage, so by allowing microfilm to be used you would not be at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a weight penalty at all and microfilm is much cheaper than Y2K2. My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach was not to ban Y2K2 but allow other covering choices in those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events so more freedom of choice. It was voted down. Now there was a vote
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taken on Y2K2 by the Indoor board as to if it was considered &quot;commercially&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; available since it was an experimental roll of film and some AMA events
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; require the covering to be commercially available.  At the time there was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suppose to be another bulk roll of the film so it was allowed as another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; roll was in surplus but it seems after several years it was thrown out so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the promise of lots of future Y2K2 went down the drain and that is when the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trouble started in availability.  Personally I fail to see how trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ban Y2K2 being meaningful in any way on a 1.2 gram model or the upcoming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1.4 gram version on the basis of it giving a competitive edge.  I do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want to sound like a broken record but 65cm models were much bigger and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; longer and were 1 gram and flew on much heavier rubber, I used 14&quot; loops
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weighing 1.4 grams and launched at torques up to .7 in oz on 14&quot; motor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sticks. Going form 9&quot; chord to 7.8&quot; and span from 65 down to 55cm and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increasing the weight  from 1.0 to 1.2 gram and much smaller cross section
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rubber made the models much easier to build to weight with either plastic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or microfilm, the two I build for USIC 2013 were ~1.1 grams with VP and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had to ballast up. So I am having trouble understanding all the posts about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how a few mg covering difference from Y2K to OS film is of such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; significance on a model that weighs comparatively so much to its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predecessor, even more so with the upcoming 1.4 gram weight. The way I see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it now, to get a model to balance with a 7&quot; stick under the new 1.4 gram
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rules you probably need a microfilm covered wing, and a Polymicro covered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stab to get the CG back far enough!
