Obviously I'm not Nick. ;)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Please bear in mind that this is my analysis and it is not infallible, neither is it provided in that perspective. I stand to be corrected if someone else provides proof that I goofed, and in some cases, it is a bit of guess work. Others are a little more obvious.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;From the photos I've seen, and I've scoured the net over the last few years looking for them, the vast majority of Schramm's models appear to be OS covered. I base this on my own experience with the film--not all OS is created equal, and covering technique and quality strongly influence the coloration. Lutz's film looks to be crinkled prior to application. I have several flying surfaces that are the same colors--now that I've learned how to cover in a more worthy matter. I do agree that the destroy model looks to be Y2K2 covered at least on the stab and rudder...the covering looks distinctly different than in other photos of his models.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Treger's models appear to make use of Y2K2 mainly to allow the use of more boron. From videos and such, they appear to be unbelievably stiff. Even with that amount of boron, I don't understand how he gets that much stiffness. It is worthy of note that Treger's flying surfaces are covered such that the film is taught spanwise, but based on videos, it is loose enough chordwise to allow considerable ballooning under flight loads.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;The other Czech models appear to be a mix of OS and Y2K2...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Here is a group of definitively OS covered models: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/airsports_fai/9686296696/sizes/l">https://www.flickr.com/photos/airsports_fai/9686296696/sizes/l</a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/airsports_fai/9686296696/sizes/l">https://www.flickr.com/photos/airsports_fai/9686296696/sizes/l</a>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;I don't care what it's covered with, I want one of these: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/airsports_fai/9686296628/sizes/l">https://www.flickr.com/photos/airsports_fai/9686296628/sizes/l</a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/airsports_fai/9686296628/sizes/l">https://www.flickr.com/photos/airsports_fai/9686296628/sizes/l</a>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;There is definitely something of a bias toward Y2K2, but I definitely wouldn't call it a consensus. As I proceeded through those photos, I noted numerous models covered in each. Also, that album is not definitive, in that I've seen other albums of last year's Ech which showed a number of other models.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;OS film is more of a Western thing, so to speak. Having been involved in FF at the time of the last rules change, it seemed to me that the Eastern European modelers took a longer time to move away from microfilm. The same appears to have been true with Y2K2.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Y2K2 does present a structural advantage, and it always will...There is a photo of Mark Bennett's Y2K (not Y2K2) covered OPP in the albums here. I've seen photos of another OPP that looked to be microfilm covered. A bit extreme in my eyes, but Y2k/Y2K2 came before OS, so there's that as well.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;That's my thought on the matter...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;If we go from the proposal rather than the meeting minutes, this is all irrelevant anyway. I'm more excited about the existence of more photos from the 2013 Ech than anything else. There were good photos there of neat planes I've wanted good photos of!
