*Attached the text here in email format for those who might have trouble
<br />
downloading or opening the word file*
<br />
<br />*-Ben*
<br />
<br /><br />*Dear Friends,*
<br />
<br />The situation of the F1D class at the international level is much more
<br />
complex than to react based only on emotions, temper or personal interest.
<br />
As we all like this class, we would like to keep it on the long term.
<br />
Please, read the following text from this point of view. Maybe it is a bit
<br />
long, but I intended to give as much details and background as I could,
<br />
including some historical data.
<br />
<br />*The role of Hungary concerning the class:*
<br />
<br />F1D was adopted to become championship class by a Hungarian proposal, and
<br />
Hungary was one of the 5 countries which participated in the first WCh
<br />
(1961, Cardington). After the second WCh (1962, Cardington) the two years
<br />
periodicity came in, but there was no offer for the 1964 WCh. Hungary put
<br />
in an offer for 1966 to save the class contrary to the fact, the hall in
<br />
Debrecen was not fully adequate for the90 cm models, mainly because of the
<br />
quite small floor area. Since we had at least one offer for the WChamps,
<br />
but in about the recent ten years, time to time I had to inspire the only
<br />
two potential organizers to put bids in to have at least one.
<br />
<br />At the time of the previous rule change, Hungary was the reigning team
<br />
world champion and I was the vice world champion. Now Hungary is the
<br />
reigning European team champion, fourth time in a row, seventh time in the
<br />
total of ten EuChamps. We have three individual title (Ree (2) and Orsovai)
<br />
and further podiums (all the three team members). Several world records
<br />
were also set by the present team members in Cat.II site (Orsovai (6), Ree
<br />
(5), Sukosd (1)).
<br />
<br />15 years ago the resistance against the rule change was much stronger but
<br />
later on the high majority of competitors became happy with the radically
<br />
changed rules.
<br />
<br />Believe us, the Hungarian indoor flyers are no way the enemies of the US or
<br />
other indoor flyers.
<br />
<br />*Let me share what are the two main problems with F1D? *
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Our favorite class is in serious danger* to be dropped as championship
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class, having rather low number of participating countries at our
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;championships. (At WCh the max. number was 17 in 1986 Cardington, at EuCh
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 in 2003 London.)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Recently FAI-CIAM movement is in progress to increase the minimum number
<br />
of entering countries to have valid continental and world champs (so called
<br />
first class events). The long time existing present value is rather low,
<br />
minimum 4 countries are required (FAI Sporting Code, General Section,
<br />
paragraph 3.5.3.1), but it is criticized since a while.
<br />
<br />Because of the increasing of this minimum number to 14, two FF classes are
<br />
in immediate danger, F1D and F1E (slope soaring gliders by magnet
<br />
steering), and in general the junior championships. As the juniors are the
<br />
future, the FFSC unanimously and strongly opposed the drastic increase of
<br />
this minimum number. We can’t say the 4 is a realistic number, but a
<br />
drastic increase is a knife on the throat of these classes. Finally, it was
<br />
decided, that classes which have junior champs are exemptions. But
<br />
recently, you have seen in Slanic, only three countries were participating
<br />
in the junior event, therefore the minimum number of 4 was not met. Just
<br />
the exceptional situation in Ukraine (the fourth country on the final entry
<br />
list but didn’t appear) gave the possibility to celebrate the winners as
<br />
champions (after getting permission from the CIAM Bureau during the days of
<br />
the event).
<br />
<br />There are several countries active in indoor, but never or just
<br />
occasionally participating at champs. It is very important to increase
<br />
their chance to participate. To increase their interest a World Cup serial
<br />
in F1D probably would be helpful. Romania would be ready to participate in
<br />
a World Cup serial (by organizing the Otto Hints Memorial), but other
<br />
events would also be needed in other countries. We have chance for that
<br />
only if the cost of these would be as low as possible by using smaller
<br />
sites, flying shorter flights during less days.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*There is lack of organizers, *at the moment we have only one country,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romania at Slanic.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;The main reason we had only two potential organizers in the last 18 years
<br />
is the rental cost of the halls. Before, Japan had to cancel one time,
<br />
because the cost of the hall raised up to 38 thousand USD. Another case was
<br />
the cancellation of a Czech bid because the hall cost increased to about 10
<br />
times higher value after the privatization.
<br />
<br />We had these two organizers, because In Slanic the cost is not as high as
<br />
in case of a sport hall or hangar (the part of the mine we use is not used
<br />
for other purposes). The fair hall in Belgrade was used in the summer break
<br />
and the organizer had some state support.
<br />
<br />Now we have lost Belgrade, because the support would be possible only in
<br />
case of minimum 16 entering countries at a European champ and 25 countries
<br />
at a WCh. No one of these values was reached ever in case of F1D and we
<br />
have no chance to reach them in the near future. So, by now, we have only
<br />
one potential organizer, at least up to 2016.
<br />
<br />That is a luck Romania became active again, I was inspiring them as before
<br />
I did so with the Serbian organizers as well. (I also spent a lot of time
<br />
with the CD of the first champs in Serbia dealing with the organizing and
<br />
contest running details.)
<br />
<br />There is another new danger for maintaining the championship status: in
<br />
case there is no championship organizer for a 4 years period, the class may
<br />
lose this status. It already happened before, we had no WCh organizer in
<br />
1964, and no EuCh organizer in 1989, 1995, 1999 and 2001.
<br />
<br />It was said, F1D became too much Europe centric. Maybe yes, as only Europe
<br />
gave organizers since 1996 up to2016. The European countries keep the
<br />
championship status of the class, keep the class alive internationally,
<br />
otherwise we already would have been lost this status. The only stable
<br />
oversees participants are the US and Japan.
<br />
<br />*Details Relating CIAM and my role in CIAM: *
<br />
<br />I have about 30 years CIAM experience (as FF sub-committee member,
<br />
delegate, Bureau member as 3rd vice-president and treasurer). My main
<br />
mission in these activities always was to support FF (first of all indoor)
<br />
and the whole aeromodeling sport. I was involved in nearly all kind of CIAM
<br />
activity, including several rule change procedures as well. You may believe
<br />
me I always was in favor of the class instead of my own or any national
<br />
interest. By my mind it is important, that I am the only Bureau member, who
<br />
always remained active competitor, national team member, participating at
<br />
championship level as well. This way I know both sides.
<br />
<br />It is funny, but somehow understandable, that according to my long time
<br />
experience the majority of top competitors are against the changes in all
<br />
classes. (Look at the message of John Barker on this list.) When I have
<br />
tried to reach a majority agreement between top Hungarian competitors in a
<br />
given class, it never succeeded (the only exemption is F1D).
<br />
<br />*About the rule changes:*
<br />
<br />The 0.4 g rubber is not a new idea. First, already in 2002 (!), Dieter
<br />
Siebenmann raised up the 0.4 g rubber idea when models were disappearing in
<br />
the CargoLifter hangar at a height of about 80 m. Later on, since about 4-6
<br />
years, time to time we were talking about possible changes at the European
<br />
and world champs, including a smaller span as well to fit to the reduced
<br />
airliner limits. (Just a remark: by my mind, the 55 cm span raised up first
<br />
by Rich Doig years before the previous rule change, also to fit to the
<br />
actual limits for hand luggage.) John Kagan in Belgrade told us, the US
<br />
team never had problem with the boxes which accommodate the 55 cm models.
<br />
On the other hand, we had problem in 2003 at Heathrow airport returning
<br />
from the EuCh.
<br />
<br />So, the intention to put in such a proposal is not new, I was pushed since
<br />
years by some competitors – not only in Hungary – to do it, some others
<br />
were against. The situation explained in points 1 and 2 affirmed the
<br />
intention to submit the proposal to help a wider range international
<br />
activity in the potential countries by the shorter flight and event
<br />
duration and the easier access to build reliable models. Of course, there
<br />
is no guarantee for that, but at least it gives chance.
<br />
<br />The implementation date of the changes is January 1, 2015, therefore the
<br />
first championship using the new rules will be the 2015 EuChamp, then first
<br />
at world champ in 2016. We intend to apply the rule changes already in this
<br />
year at the Hungarian events.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;Kind regards
<br />
