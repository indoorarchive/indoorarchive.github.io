I will offer the opinion of complete indoor beginner here, for whatever it's worth.  I am currently struggling to get a LPP and F1l to weight.  Those are relatively simple classes compared to F1D.  F1D is pretty much the pinnacle of indoor duration classes and allowing completed models to be purchased seems like it would take much of the prestige away from these aircraft and the event.  Now don't get me wrong, if  F1D were available for purchase, I would be first in line to buy one, as I doubt I will ever have the time, patience, skill, etc. required to build and compete with one.  But I think that would take away from the hobby.  At the WC level in F1D, or any indoor contest, it should be difficult.  The inherent nature of duration flying is difficult, at least for peak performance.
<br />
&nbsp;Society has put this idea into everyone's head that we should be able to do anything we want to, and if we can't do it on our own, then we should be accommodated.  But that, to me at least, isn't reality.  
<br />
<br />Does it hurt that I don't have the time, skill, resources to compete in F1D?  Yes, it does, as I would love to fly at Slanic and represent my country.  But, I am currently not there, and honestly, right now, don't deserve to be there.  I haven't put in the time, nor developed the skills to get there.  So I really should t be able to buy my plane, and call it good.  I think it does take away from the event.
<br />
<br />Sometimes reality just plain hurts.  
<br />
<br />The other qualm I have with purchased models would be that competition could very well become an arms race.  He who spends the most money on a model, wins.  Now I know flyer skill would be important, but I am sure with 5 grand to spend, someone could hire someone to build a dominant F1D, and with relatively little skill, consistently win with it.  This takes away from the spirit of the hobby.  As it stands now, there are like 3 or 4 suppliers (that I know of) offer wood for F1D, and they all charge
<br />
about the same ( though shipping to the states from England can be pricey) for their wood.  So the playing field is close to level there. 
<br />
<br />I know there are arguments either way. And honestly, all have merit.  There
<br />
Is no black and white here.  The above ramblings are just my thoughts/opinions, written by a
<br />
relatively low skilled hobbyist who is amazed And inspired by those with a greater skill set. I just think we
<br />
need to accept the fact that at this level, F1D is really hard and some will have the skills and/or develop them, and others won't.  Those who develop new and innovative skills and techniques or models that are superior frankly, should win, as they have conquered the physical world in a way which no one else has before them.
<br />
<br />Happy building/flying.
<br />
Chris

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Interesting that you define it as fraud for a degree as it will destroy the value of it yet do not extend that respect to the F1D model for a hobby which you admittedly love. I feel it is equally fraudulent and will destroy the value of F1D just as it would destroy the value of a college degree. I went to college for engineering as I found that topic interesting, it was my &quot;hobby&quot; so why not just let me buy answers to homework and tests for my &quot;hobby&quot; of engineering? The more engineers the better for the future of the engineering hobby right?  My point       here is the argument can and does work both ways, I find the basis for allowing a purchased F1D as equally fraudulent as buying answers to a test.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think there is a tiny difference between helping each other with a hobby we love (which is good for the future of it) and 'helping' each other with fraud at university (which will definitely destroys the value of the degree).
