Not being an F1D flyer I have stayed out of this but after reading the
<br />
proposal feel I have to insert my 2 cents.  To me the line that really
<br />
turns me off is:
<br />
<br />The top flyers might keep their chances to win but the gap could well be
<br />
closed
<br />
<br />Over the years I have seen this justification used for rules changes in
<br />
many events - People, it doesn't work - the top flyers will remain the
<br />
top flyers except for the few who get disgusted and just plain quit.

<br /><br /><br />Hello,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
A few of you already know me; my name is Chuck Etherington and I am the
<br />
US FAI representative to the CIAM. I belong to the Magnificent Mountain
<br />
Men (MMM) FF club and although my FAI event is F1C, I like to dabble a
<br />
little in indoor (mostly watching) during the Colorado winters. I’ve had
<br />
some conversations with several people about the Hungarian F1D proposal
<br />
and am familiar with the issue. As Nick pointed out, the first step is to
<br />
collect data to establish what the majority of US F1D flyers desire. I’m
<br />
pretty sure I know the answer but would be wise to confirm via a poll.
<br />
Unfortunately, the INAV poll doesn’t identify who the US fliers are.
<br />
However, due to the fact that no one thus far has voted in favor of the
<br />
proposal, I can easily draw the conclusion that the US indoor community,
<br />
as a whole, is opposed.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Once the poll has run its course (not sure how long it is intended to
<br />
run), the next step will be to lobby the FAI “technical experts”
<br />
representing the other voting countries. To do that I will need a
<br />
well-worded argument. I can compose one from the various messages I’ve
<br />
received and from forum threads, but it might be more appropriate (and
<br />
accurate) if two or three US F1D fliers collaborated. My suggestion would
<br />
be to start with the three “Reason” paragraphs in the proposal and break
<br />
them down point by point. A separate counter-point can be offered for
<br />
each. Aversions not previously discussed can then be introduced. Could I
<br />
get two or three F1D guys to take on that task? Please let me know.
<br />
Thanks.  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Also, in compiling the info in INAV, Joshua Finn made a very good
<br />
suggestion: It is important that non US fliers contact the CIAM Technical
<br />
Expert(s) from their respective nations.

Much has been said on this topic already, some people have even contacted
<br />
their CIAM rep. I would like to ask you all to vote in the INAV poll.
<br />
Chuck has asked for as much data as possible to help him advocate for us.

It would take an exceptionally dedicated 12 year old to make an F1D. If
<br />
my own kids are any sort of indication, girls should do better due to
<br />
their superior physical coordination. My daughter enjoys building for
<br />
short stretches, but I don't see her putting 40 hours plus into an F1D
<br />
anytime soon. LPP? Sure!
<br />
<br />Not saying it can't be done. Having a mentor would drastically increase
<br />
the chances of success.
