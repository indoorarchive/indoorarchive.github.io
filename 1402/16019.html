I have a few comments on the F1D rule change proposal.  The weight gain from using OS film rather than the lightest Y2K2 is 45mg-60mg depending on the weight of the particular batch of OS film.  The rules proposal also gave as a reason the use of new and heavier materials for making reliable parts such as vp and vd hubs and this applies to the new trend toward carbon outlines.  Sparless props made with carbon outlines weigh about 50mg more than the older, spared balsa props (both with vp hubs) as the heavier outlines (75mg each) are partially compensated by the elimination of the full length spar (these weights all depend on the builder's choices and skills).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;The proposal is also somewhat Euro-centric with he claim that the only two Eastern European sites are available for World Championship contests so there is a need to look at smaller, lower sites.  I think people forget about the Kibbie Dome and other sites around the world (and this related to another thread on elimination of World Championships that are Euro-centric).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;It would be much easier to build an F1D to the 1.4g weight.  The reduced weight may not allow for the use of more readily available materials but rather for the use of heavier but stiffer (and perhaps, still rare) materials.  However, this increased weight may allow for designs directions which have been largely unexplored because of the weight penalties imposed by the designs.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Tapio brings up a good point about model size and airline carry on requirements.  The current 55cm plane needs box which is larger than the size allowed by most airlines.  We have been fortunate in that the size rules are not strictly enforce at this time but this may come soon.  One other point about the increased weight limit as one might consider companion rule change that would not allow the use or boron fibers.  Some people are concerned about boron fiber use for safety reasons.  I am comfortable using boron but some are not.  Banning the use of materials for safety reasons is common in the sporting world.  The banning of the use of beryllium, even as part of an aluminum matrix material, in auto racing is such an example.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Perhaps, as was done near the turn of the century, it is time to look again at the F1D rules.  The related BOM and Euro-centric v. AMA class discussions along with this rule change proposal may be warnings that we need to take a more in depth look at our sport and its rules.
