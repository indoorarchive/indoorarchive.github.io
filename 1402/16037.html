This came out yesterday in an e-mail and was talk of the evening up in Racine last night:
<br />
<br />As many of you know and the younger ones among us will learn, you reach a point in your life where you start considering what is important and where you want to invest your time &amp; energy. Karen and I have reached this point and have decided it is time to make some changes. While were were busy making some personal changes, it became obvious we needed to look at business changes as well. 
<br />
A2Z Corp has 2 main components. The original portion is the A2Z CNC line of machined items like the Jones and McLeod strippers modelers are familar with as well as the much larger line of accessories and upgrades for small scale metal worker and hobbyist. Model airplane products joined A2Z when I combine the separate Tru-Weight Indoor Balsa and F1D.biz business into A2Z. Once we were in the model business some very interesting opportunities that lead to us purchasing Peck, Indoor Model Supply, Sting Aero as well as numerous products. Things worked fine as we were still small and there were 2 of us modelers working in the buisness and we prospered and grew. Fast forward and we had to add employees, the knowledgeable modelers had other opportunities come up, and we moved to a bigger building. Life looked good.
<br />
Over time it became clear that we were experiencing issues due to personnel that didn't understand models or why things are done certain ways. We tried training, different employees, different managers, documentation, etc. After a few years of this Karen and I have decided it is time to simplify the business so skills and training issues are greatly reduced as well as allowing us to concentrate our efforts on A2Z CNC and the successful brand we have built in that division.
<br />
Enough rambling, Karen and I have decided it is time to sell the model airplane portions of A2Z. Our desire is to have A2Z down to a single division company about the time the flying weather gets good. We are talking to a possible buyer, but there are no solid deals in the works yet. If you or someone you know has a serious interest in a business in the FF model world we are looking for buyer(s) of individual portions or the entire division. It can be fun, exciting, challenging, and even profitable for the right person.
<br />
If we are unable to find buyer(s), our plan is to close down the model division by summer. We hope for the benefit of the FF community that we can find buyer(s) to carry these legends forward. But it is time for us to focus and move forward with renewed focus.
<br />
Thanks for the years of support,
<br />
Tim Goldstein
