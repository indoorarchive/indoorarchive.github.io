<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And for Don S.'s benefit, you place the blame on those folks if you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like, but I always thought they were great guys. And they never yelled 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at me for violating unwritten rules.
</em><br />
Sorry your friends had a bad experience, but I think indoor folks are 
<br />
great guys and very helpful. But going down the name calling road is 
<br />
ridiculous. I can list a few FAC things which I have witnessed or have 
<br />
had done to me over the years, shall I then define or perceive all FAC 
<br />
based on what happened to me or people I know?
<br />
<br />1) Banned a Nocal on site at an event for violating the spirit of the event
<br />
2) Erasing an official EZB score of a score sheet because the CD (a 
<br />
current high rank FAC person) did not agree that steering an indoor 
<br />
model should really be allowed and after some consideration felt the 
<br />
flight should not count (even though it was a legal steer) so erased the 
<br />
flight but did not bother to tell the contestant until the awards were 
<br />
being handed out.
<br />
3) The following year, told my dad that only he (the CD) would be 
<br />
allowed to tell a modeler when he was allowed to steer and that was 
<br />
literally 1 second before it hit the wall he said &quot;Now&quot;, and if my dad 
<br />
tried to steer his EZB before that his was told his flight would be DQ
<br />
4) After winning a Nocal mass launch the CD then decided that he wanted 
<br />
to fly one more round and do it all over again.
<br />
5) Yelled at a well known indoor modeler at the Bufflalo Bills 
<br />
fieldhouse because the indoor modeler (and the rest of us) did not want 
<br />
to hear music played on the speaker system in the whole building
<br />
6)banned a persons model because it won too many times
<br />
7) having a FAC judge accidentally skip judging my model after saying &quot; 
<br />
not another one of those&quot; when I dropped it off for judging, then he 
<br />
left after judging so I could not enter the event.
<br />
<br />What conclusion or perception shall I draw about the FAC based on these 
<br />
things which have happened? I am sorry someone's feelings got hurt at 
<br />
some event in the past but if that is the reason they will not fly F1D 
<br />
or indoor then I think that is still just an excuse.
<br />
<br />My dad once had  a person run in front of him when he was getting ready 
<br />
to launch his EZB at the USIC and the person's wake broke his wing and 
<br />
stab and he was not able to repair the plane in time, and also had a guy 
<br />
open a door about 15ft away from his bench and the wind sucked his model 
<br />
model off the table and into the doorway breaking the wing and stab as 
<br />
it tumbled. I understand outsiders may not understand such details that 
<br />
something as simple as opening a door can destroy a model. But that is 
<br />
the nature of indoor.
<br />
