Jake,
<br />
<br />I am sorry that my first sentence was so ambiguous: I did not mean that I
<br />
wanted the equipment to be as similar as possible but that that was what
<br />
Ruling Bodies aimed for.  On your second point about diversity in F1D
<br />
design, I agree that there has been a steady progression over the years but
<br />
recently it seems to me that diversity did not bring home much silverware
<br />
unless the flyer had good tan2 and a VP hub.
<br />

<br />
<br />&quot;However, talking strictly of F1D, I return to the fact that this is an
<br />
International Class.  International Classes almost always are seeking for
<br />
the best participant in a particular sport or pastime and to that end the
<br />
equipment used should be as similar as possible.&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I couldn't disagree with this statement more.  F1D has always had a wide
<br />
range of diversity in design.  Why would we want to reduce that diversity?
<br />
If everyone is flying the same model, then the only difference is who's
<br />
better at adjusting the screws on their hub, and who got the most winds into
<br />
the best rubber.  That's far less interesting to me.

<br />Mark,
<br />
<br />I find it interesting that, in the past, when discussing items arising on
<br />
forums we have always been in accord but on this occasion I am in complete
<br />
opposition!  My earlier comments on BOM received no response, perhaps
<br />
because I was talking about BOM in general and because I don't fly F1D.
<br />
However your, 'Who does the gluing?' suggestion (and indeed most other
<br />
responses) just remind me of how the BMFA rules kept getting more and more
<br />
complicated with no chance of satisfying more than a small group of people
<br />
and that is why BOM was removed in England, I think to the relief of most
<br />
flyers.

<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />A minor point, but still important to the rule makers, is that simple rules
<br />
are preferred because International rules need to be translated into many
<br />
languages and it is not simple to convey nuances of meaning between them.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />In many ways the traditional method of trusting people over the BOM has
<br />
worked well but that world has changed and won't go back.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />This discussion has arisen over VP hubs and whether they can be bought
<br />
items.  I suggest that the only simple answer; and the one likely to be
<br />
accepted by the International rule makers is to ban VP hubs altogether.

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />average kit&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;If I was a beginner and wanting to get into this or any sport, why would I
<br />
buy an &quot;average kit&quot;?  Would it not be better to buy one that is &quot;above
<br />
average&quot;?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />From this standpoint the rule itself makes zero sense.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Ditto, Joe 'keen.  The rules should not be hinged around what some kitmaker
<br />
wishes to make available or not--what a moving target!   So since we're in
<br />
&quot;old-men-repetition-mode&quot; I will make one final cast here--final because I
<br />
no longer have a dog in this hunt myself, and I received only one note of
<br />
support previously from one Indoor competitor (a notable Indoorist, in that
<br />
case.) 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />The following concept should be relatively simple and doable, if we can hit
<br />
upon some good language.  This would require some compromise from both
<br />
sides.  But it removes the whim of the kitmaker from the equation, and also
<br />
does not burden the CD except to ask a simple question about compliance.
<br />
(Those who want to cheat still can, but simplicity will support natural
<br />
compliance.)   
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />The builder/competitor must simply be the one who glues anything and
<br />
everything together,  and that's almost the whole proposition. A kit maker
<br />
(or whatever helper) wanting to provide as much &quot;above averageness&quot; as
<br />
possible would be allowed to cut and form anything (such as a preformed wing
<br />
tip bend) but the competitor has to attach to spar.  A helper could roll a
<br />
motor tube blank, but the builder would have to glue the seam, and attach to
<br />
rest of model. The kitmaker/helper could provide a preformed F1d prop
<br />
outline, but  not with the root joint preglued.  The kitter/helper could
<br />
provide exactly trimmed ribs, but competitor must do all gluing to outline.
<br />
Similar concept applies to covering processes.  The competitor must handle
<br />
and apply the adhesive for covering model.    .
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />A few kinks around this idea probably exist in use of composite structures,
<br />
and would require some tedious language to sort out what &quot;a component&quot; is or
<br />
should be.  Seems consistent to say let's allow any carbon layup component
<br />
to be considered &quot;a preformed part&quot; analogous to preformed balsa, even
<br />
though the epoxy resin is a glue of sorts.  But (here's the awkward part)
<br />
where two different material types are laminated (such as
<br />
carbon-foam-carbon) the builder/competitor must perform the additional
<br />
gluing processes.  
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />What could possibly go wrong?  (Just kidding, there.)  But PM me if you are
<br />
a stakeholder (which I probably no longer am)  and we can attempt an actual
<br />
BOM rule revision, instead of (per Kagan, I borrow) Old-Mens-Repetition
<br />
every time we remember again.
