Don, to be clear, I said that the FAC has its own issues (which I occasionally mention elsewhere and often get ignored -- though things are improving with new leadership), but I tend to consider the indoor FAC activities to be a different thing. There is some real weirdness that goes on there and I've seen it in person much to my frustration (remember that thing about unwritten rules?). That is stuff worth yelling over, but in my experience, the things that generate yelling are piddly junk. I've had my share of planes smashed by competitors walking past, even a few good flights decimated by people opening doors, and like most of the folks I've flown with around here, was too busy fixing the damage to fuss out the culprit. Personally I think there needs to be a greater willingness to report CD's who cheat (yes, imposing made up rules is cheating), but also a greater willingness for contestants to obtain CD licenses (one of my plans once I'm settled in, so I'm not trying to get folks to do what I don't do) since that is perhaps a better way to fix the problem.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;My concern, however, is not that we rehash these issues, but that we make a concerted effort to end them. The way forward is to stop the previous behavior, a thing I'm saying as much to myself as to others. Sadly, the perception of parts of indoor being unfriendly is not an excuse, and here's why: would you be interested in taking up a new and challenging type of model competition reputed to be very difficult if everyone told you that the participants were unfriendly and unhelpful? That's a powerful motivator to not take it up, and that's what I was told. I finally took up F1D because several of my friends kept bugging me to try it. And that's how you get new participation.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Good flying,
