This was recently proposed by Jerry Murphy, long-time freeflighter from Colorado Springs. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Brief summary of the proposed change. Add a new set of record categories for performance in sites located at higher altitudes .
<br />
&nbsp;These new categories would be based on the same ceiling heights as the current categories except they would apply to sites
<br />
&nbsp;located at elevations of 5,000 feet above sea lever or greater.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Flying for Record. National record performances shall be recognized for flights made in each of the following types of buildings:
<br />
&nbsp;Category I Buildings having ceilings less than 8 meters (26' 3&quot;).
<br />
&nbsp;Category II Buildings having ceilings between 8 and 15 meters (26' 3&quot; to 49' 2.5&quot;).
<br />
&nbsp;Category III Buildings having ceilings between 15 and 30 meters (49' 2.5&quot; to 98' 5&quot;).
<br />
&nbsp;Category IV Buildings having ceiling over 30 meters (higher than 98' 5&quot;).
<br />
&nbsp;Category I HA ( High Altitude) Buildings located at an elevation of 5000 feet above sea level or greater having ceilings less than 8 meters (26'3&quot;)
<br />
&nbsp;Category II HA (High Altitude) Buildings located at an elevation of 5,000 feet above sea level or greater having ceilings between 8 meters and 15 meters (26'3&quot; to 19' 2.5&quot;)
<br />
&nbsp;Category III HA (High Altitude) Buildings located at an elevation of 5,000 feet above sea level or greater having ceilings between 15 and 30 meters (49' 2.5&quot; to 98' 5&quot;)
<br />
&nbsp;Category IV HA High Altitude) Buildings located at an elevation of 5,000 feet above sea level or greater having ceiling over 30 meters high (98' 5&quot;)
<br />
&nbsp;Logic behind proposed change, including alleged shortcomings of the present rules. State intent for future reference.
<br />
&nbsp;There are many very good indoor sites located in the Rocky Mountain West that fail to attract the top level indoor competitors because it is not possible to set records at the altitude of these venues. This results in the sanctioning of events conflicting with sanctioned events in these sites resulting in financial losses to the clubs attempting to increase indoor participation in their area. This has a negative impact on the club's ability to be involved with STEM and Science Olympiad programs. The establishing of the new high altitude record categories will create an incentive for current record holders to fly in these events. An another benefit of the addition of these new high altitude record categories is the clubs will benefit from learning form the top competitors who come to try for these new records.
