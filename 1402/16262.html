At Chuck's request, Joshua Finn, and I have composed the following letter.
<br />
It would great to have some signatories in addition to ourselves for the
<br />
letter. If you would like to add your name, or think something should be
<br />
changed please contact me off-list.
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />
<br />Nick Ray
<br />
<br />Dear CIAM Technical Experts,
<br />
<br /><br /><br />The rationale behind changing the current F1D rules is based on several
<br />
misconceptions and the supposition that proposed rule changes will
<br />
alleviate perceived shortcomings. The proposal first cites organizational
<br />
considerations for changing the rules. Then the proposal contends that
<br />
model weight should be raised to compensate for the unavailability of
<br />
exotic materials. Lastly, the proposal states that current models will be
<br />
usable under the new rules and that changing the rules may bring new
<br />
participants into the event. By carefully examining the reasons behind the
<br />
rule changes and the foreseeable effects of changing the rules, it becomes
<br />
clear that this proposal is not in the best interest of F1D.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />The first argument for changing rules cites a decrease in the number of
<br />
flying sites. However, the number of sites putting in world championship
<br />
bids has remained constant since the previous rule change. There is also
<br />
talk of a bid from a U.S. Category IV site for 2016. The current world
<br />
records already show a reduction in flight times as the ceiling height is
<br />
reduced. As such, it is likely that competitions in smaller sites would
<br />
naturally experience a reduction in duration. The proposal goes on to cite
<br />
a need to decrease the duration of contests to reduce costs. Indeed, the
<br />
cost of hosting a contest could be greatly reduced by flying three rounds
<br />
per day rather than two. Doing so would reduce the contest duration by a
<br />
full day without changing the models. Contests could also be shortened by
<br />
flying on partial motors (i.e. 0.3g rubber and 0.3g ballast), when
<br />
organizational needs dictate, without changing the current rules.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />The proposal's position on material availability is logically unsound
<br />
because the proposal does not seek to ban exotic materials from
<br />
competition. Therefore, any advantage a competitor currently has will be
<br />
carried over to the new rules. Indeed, in an event that is the pinnacle of
<br />
its discipline, it stands to reason that materials should not be restricted
<br />
except when they pose a hazard to participants. Moreover, reliable models
<br />
and variable pitch and variable diameter mechanisms are being produced at
<br />
the current weight limit by Ivan Treger, Lutz Schramm, Brett Sanborn, and
<br />
many others. Increasing the weight limit will likely allow for innovations
<br />
such as tip-plates, electronics and more composite components. Thus, the
<br />
flying times will rapidly approach those currently seen in competition.
<br />
<br /><br />The proposal concludes its rationale statement by stating that the rule
<br />
change will likely make F1D more appealing to new participants and may
<br />
close the gap between top competitors and the rest of the field. The
<br />
previous rule change in 2000 also touted the potential for increased
<br />
participation, but as Brett Sanborn pointed out, the average attendance at
<br />
world championships was 34.667 participants from 1972-2000 and 34.667 from
<br />
2002-2012. It is possible that other factors convolute this figure, but
<br />
empirically, it would appear that rule changes do not have a great impact
<br />
on participation.
<br />
<br /><br />History has shown that the notion that rule changes close the gap between
<br />
competitors is fallacious. Jim Richmond weathered many such rule changes
<br />
and, in spite of them, won more world championships than anyone else in F1D
<br />
history. The problem with this notion is that it asserts the presumption
<br />
that the best fliers are successful because they have stumbled into a
<br />
paradigm that works for a particular event. It ignores the fact that the
<br />
best fliers tend to be the fliers who practice frequently, search out the
<br />
best materials, and innovate constantly.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />In order to fly competitively, participants will need to exploit the rule
<br />
changes with new models. Reducing the motor weight will shift the center of
<br />
gravity forward considerably. Moreover, the shorter motor will lead to
<br />
redesigned fuselages. There is also some conjecture that because the models
<br />
built under the proposed rules have not been tested in high ceiling sites,
<br />
the models may not have enough power to fly well. Indeed, high ceiling F1D
<br />
may start to look more like F1B with steep climbs and long glides after the
<br />
motor is out of turns.
<br />
<br />For the reasons stated above, this rule change proposal simultaneously
<br />
seeks to alleviate perceived issues that do not actually exist and make
<br />
changes that do not solve the problems that the proposal claims to solve.
<br />
Therefore, the CIAM Technical Experts are urged to vote against this rule
<br />
change proposal.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Thank you for your time and service,
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Nick Ray
