<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've sat back and observed this BOM  controversy and  the so called  arrogance of Indoor flyers .Iwas there at all of Don's examples  The reason I don't fly any FAC scale events is because of the same comments heard when taking my Fike model in for judging and having the same model getting widely different scale points depending on who was judging. So I chose events that were not subjective... just look at the watch .It's the same reason I only like certain Olympic events...just look at the watch!!!  the time will tell whose the better airplane.no muss no fuss...I've only built 3 Peanut Scale Models since 1979, none of which received  official approval of FAC members or judges.Did I get Mad ?No....I  just chose to build modele that I like. If some guys want models that look scale and fly for 2 mins. that's fine too but not for me ...No Cal is as close to scale as I get now a days .Don and I fly them like Indoor duration.I fly and build  for a hobby so I never question anyone as to why they build any type of model... if you enjoy it build it.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And for Don S.'s benefit, you place the blame on those folks if you like, but I always thought they were great guys. And they never yelled at me for violating unwritten rules.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry your friends had a bad experience, but I think indoor folks are great guys and very helpful. But going down the name calling road is ridiculous. I can list a few FAC things which I have witnessed or have had done to me over the years, shall I then define or perceive all FAC based on what happened to me or people I know? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) Banned a Nocal on site at an event for violating the spirit of the event
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Erasing an official EZB score of a score sheet because the CD (a current high rank FAC person) did not agree that steering an indoor model should really be allowed and after some consideration felt the flight should not count (even though it was a legal steer) so erased the flight but did not bother to tell the contestant until the awards were being handed out.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) The following year, told my dad that only he (the CD) would be allowed to tell a modeler when he was allowed to steer and that was literally 1 second before it hit the wall he said &quot;Now&quot;, and if my dad tried to steer his EZB before that his was told his flight would be DQ
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) After winning a Nocal mass launch the CD then decided that he wanted to fly one more round and do it all over again. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5) Yelled at a well known indoor modeler at the Bufflalo Bills fieldhouse because the indoor modeler (and the rest of us) did not want to hear music played on the speaker system in the whole building 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 6)banned a persons model because it won too many times 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 7) having a FAC judge accidentally skip judging my model after saying &quot; not another one of those&quot; when I dropped it off for judging, then he left after judging so I could not enter the event.   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What conclusion or perception shall I draw about the FAC based on these things which have happened? I am sorry someone's feelings got hurt at some event in the past but if that is the reason they will not fly F1D or indoor then I think that is still just an excuse. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My dad once had  a person run in front of him when he was getting ready to launch his EZB at the USIC and the person's wake broke his wing and stab and he was not able to repair the plane in time, and also had a guy open a door about 15ft away from his bench and the wind sucked his model model off the table and into the doorway breaking the wing and stab as it tumbled. I understand outsiders may not understand such details that something as simple as opening a door can destroy a model. But that is the nature of indoor.
