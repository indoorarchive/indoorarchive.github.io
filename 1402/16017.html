I have tried to stay publicly out of this discussion but I can no longer resist the temptation to jump in.  Both Kang's original BOM rule change proposal and Mark's have flaws that make enforcement, other than by the current honor system, difficult.  Kang has proposed a total weight limit for purchased parts.  The only way to correctly weigh the purchased parts is to remove them, perhaps by ungluing, form the assembled plane.  A prop built from purchased outlines and vp hub will need be taken apart.  The same applies to carbon tips.  One might say that the weight of the parts is known so disassembly is not needed.  However, a vp hub and carbon outlines can weigh about 250mg, just a bit over the 20% rule Kang proposed or exactly equal to a 25% rule. I do not think a flier would like this disassembly.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Mark's proposal does not address the issue of purchased parts providing a true relief from the current BOM rules.  Rolling a tube or bending balsa outlines is not the hard part.  The hard part is the assembly.  The carbon pultrusion vp hub that Kang uses is not hard to cut from purchased tubes and sheet.  The hard part is the assembly of the pieces and the building of the correct jigs (if used).  The composite parts for Treger's hub are harder to make (the screw block and the fiberglass main and spar tubes) but even if these are purchased, the Kevlar hinges and other assembly work must be done (using jigs, perhaps) to meet Mark's rule.  And, has Mike Kirda and others have shown, prepreg carbon materials can be used with advantage for composite parts
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;John Barker is correct is observing that it is difficult to have a half-way BOM rule.  Once the BOM rule is to be relaxed, the demarcation line is on a slippery slope and will slowly but surely work its way down the slope until there are no BOM requirements.  But, I do not think this is a good reason to abandon the BOM rule.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;A very good F1D flier once complained (whined might be a better word) quite a bit about having to build vp hubs and glue balsa tubes.  But, that flier learned to to these things, thought up easier ways, and quickly began to fly with the select group of elite fliers.  Others may not be has skilled in building and flying but building an F1D is not out of the realm of possibility for just about all the people who have the desire to fly that class.  Larry Coslick can teach and help a skilled junior to build a competitive F1D (or two) in a week's time.  I think the BOM rule is not a hurdle.  I think the BOM rule is something that makes indoor duration different (and better as well as nearly unique) than many other sports and hobbies such flying purchased rc planes. The BOM rule may be a product of older (and lesser?) but I think it abandonment will be a loss rather than a gain.
