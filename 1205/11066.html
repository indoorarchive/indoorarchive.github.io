I've been following this thread for a while now and I've got to say, I'm
<br />
glad I don't have the need to compete.
<br />
<br />When my hobby becomes a job, that's when I've got to bow out and find
<br />
another hobby. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Don't get me wrong, at some point if I should make or break a record,
<br />
neat!!!,  but I'd rather just be trying to better my last flight with what's
<br />
available to me and be grateful that I'm flying at all.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&quot;Those are the main points. The one point that Diddiler did not mention is
<br />
sites. There are plenty of good sites but Indoorists seem reticent to attend
<br />
meets unless there is a real chance to set records.&quot;
<br />
<br />I cannot say anything about this statement, as I've not been involved that
<br />
long in indoor free flight, but I will say that, this coming weekend I'm
<br />
expecting a bunch of older kids at the hangar in Lakeland (middle and high
<br />
school) and in as much as they might like to compete someday, we're going to
<br />
have a bunch of fun days before that happens, learning and building.
<br />
<br />Let's see what we can each do to make indoor more popular where we live.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />All the best guys,

<br />--Extreme materials and techniques are required to be competitive (absurdly
<br />
light and stiff wood)
<br />
<br />--The best materials are not even made anymore (Y2K, May 99, light C-paper)
<br />
<br />--Poorly written rules that are exploited by experts (VP prop on A-6, plenty
<br />
of other examples)
<br />
<br />--A prevailing  attitude that indoor is just fine and does not need to grow
<br />
or improve.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Those are the main points. The one point that Diddiler did not mention is
<br />
sites. There are plenty of good sites but Indoorists seem reticent to attend
<br />

<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />If you are truly interested in learning why indoor is so unpopular I would
<br />
suggest getting a focus group together of typical model airplane lovers or
<br />
even typical FFers. The responses would likely surprise you.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />This is just my honest analysis. I wish none of this were true and indoor
<br />
was hugely popular.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Flame away.

<br />Diddler just summed up most of what's wrong with Indoor and why 99.9999% of
<br />
the population will never become &quot;indoorists&quot;.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is substantially harder to meet minimum weight than LPP and F1L. Some

aspects of building A6 are easy, but three rules make meeting minimum
<br />
difficult: 1) 1/16&quot; wood for wing spars, 2) 1/32&quot; wood for prop, 3) paper
<br />
convering&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Ya, many indoor classes have one or more relatively extreme aspects. One
<br />
famous ezb flyer doesn't do F1d due to how tightly we have to launch
<br />
(risking destruction of motorsticks here and there.) That's what's good, and
<br />
also bad about having so many indoor classes--you get to pick your poison. 
<br />
<br />I don't need to find 4.0 lb wood for anything else I build, so I'm not going
<br />
to start that hunt in order to make a long-winged 1.3&quot; chord A6 out of
<br />
1/16th square sticks. And the really light c paper is not even available
<br />
last I heard. A6 functioned just FINE as a so-called club event, even with
<br />
competing sets of rules. AMA event induction was not really needed (was my
<br />
main comment to contest board member.) But I'm happy if it keeps a few
<br />
others happy and motivated. Hope y'all are enjoying it. I might try a
<br />
variable pitch A6, heheh.
