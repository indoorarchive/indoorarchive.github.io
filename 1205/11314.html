This year was definitely an experience for me. Running tired on Wednesday resulted in a long series of mishaps that definitely left me very discouraged. Anyone who was watching would be able to tell you that my Saturday performances were a 180 degree switch. I don't see myself wasting time on A-6 for the foreseeable future, though.
<br />
<br />I've seen some exciting mass launches, but Coconut was about the most amazing I've seen. What a lot of folks don't know is that my Judy was barely trimmed the day of the contest, and I had no idea where to go with motor sizing. There was a serious mad rush to fix motor bunching issues, and I almost wiped the model out on its second flight when it went into the stands. To go to from that to a roughly 2 minute flight in WWII was a real experience.
<br />
<br />For those who haven't seen it, here's the video of the most exciting Coconut mass launch ever, featuring my Judy's first ever full power flight. My condolences to Tim Lavender, but I know he'll have something new and better next year.

<br />Oh, and free advice to anyone starting F1D or 35cm: bring a lot of spare motors. Getting to a contest and finding you have ONE motor of the proper size and then breaking it might have a slightly negative effect on your scores.
<br />
<br />Good flying,
<br />
Joshua

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I expect angry words here and there during competition.  Tension and anxiety run high, and we are vying for the national championship.  However, I think it's best to minimize angry exchanges, and especially, to not direct your disrespect to anyone.
