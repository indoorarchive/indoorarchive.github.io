A couple of the things that Indoor *does* suffer from is a lack of exposure and, apparently, some misconceptions.
<br />
<br />DeLoach shares, at regular intervals, one outsider's perspective.  I don't think it generally representative, but it has some useful bits to it.  We just need to sort the wheat from the chaff. 
<br />
<br />Saying that Indoor is &quot;unpopular&quot; is, aside from being needlessly mean, pretty wrong.  The dictionary definition of popular is, &quot;regarded with favor, approval, or affection by people in general&quot;.  I haven't met a person yet who wasn't floored by an Indoor model in flight.  Certainly nobody disapproved.
<br />
<br />But we are a niche hobby, and we need to continually strive to bring new people into the fold.  More people = more fun.
<br />
<br />It is fun to have people think that our models are absurdly extreme, and rely on unobtainable materials, but it isn't really true.  I've sneezed while holding a model, and it didn't disintegrate.  I've been on the WC podium 4 times (9, if you include the team category), and my models use OS Film and not-too-difficult-to-find wood.
<br />
<br />The various rules aren't generally written in a very precise manner, but I don't see too many examples of events actually being &quot;ruined&quot;.  That doesn't stop some people from talking about them, though.  They love to say &quot;hard&quot;-B, mostly because it makes a nice soundbite (like, &quot;the building is so big it has its own weather system&quot;).  They don't remember to mention that F1L is easier EZB with a weight limit.  It isn't as much fun to say.
<br />
<br />A VP on an A-6 is a perfect example of the syndrome.  The fact that nobody has done it yet hasn't prevented it from being used as an example of experts ruining the event.  I don't even think it will work - I don't think the flat blades will have enough pitch range to be valuable.  The only reason to make one would be to tweak DeLoach.  Which, I have to admit, makes it tempting :)
<br />
<br />We just need to make an effort to get a positive message out there, to balance out the folklore.
<br />
<br />There certainly is a prevailing attitude that Indoor is great.  It would be kind of stupid for us to spend as much time as we do if we thought it wasn't.
<br />
<br />Nobody I know wouldn't like to see it grow, though.  And, as Kang said well, &quot;improve&quot; apparently has different meanings to different people.
<br />
<br />I'm not interested in saying anything that could be construed as a &quot;flame&quot;.  The last 7 times this topic has come up is enough.  I actually find DeLoach's ideas motivating.  They make want to get up and prove them wrong :)
