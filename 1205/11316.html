Forgive me. A question: If your model had been the one that was totalled
<br />
would you still call this &quot;the most exciting mass launch ever&quot;?

<br />
<br />This year was definitely an experience for me. Running tired on Wednesday
<br />
resulted in a long series of mishaps that definitely left me very
<br />
discouraged. Anyone who was watching would be able to tell you that my
<br />
Saturday performances were a 180 degree switch. I don't see myself wasting
<br />
time on A-6 for the foreseeable future, though.
<br />
<br />I've seen some exciting mass launches, but Coconut was about the most
<br />
amazing I've seen. What a lot of folks don't know is that my Judy was barely
<br />
trimmed the day of the contest, and I had no idea where to go with motor
<br />
sizing. There was a serious mad rush to fix motor bunching issues, and I
<br />
almost wiped the model out on its second flight when it went into the
<br />
stands. To go to from that to a roughly 2 minute flight in WWII was a real
<br />
experience.
<br />
<br />For those who haven't seen it, here's the video of the most exciting Coconut
<br />
mass launch ever, featuring my Judy's first ever full power flight. My
<br />
condolences to Tim Lavender, but I know he'll have something new and better
<br />
next year.

<br />
<br />Oh, and free advice to anyone starting F1D or 35cm: bring a lot of spare
<br />
motors. Getting to a contest and finding you have ONE motor of the proper
<br />
size and then breaking it might have a slightly negative effect on your
<br />
scores.
<br />
<br />Good flying,
<br />
Joshua

anxiety run high, and we are vying for the national championship. However, I

think it's best to minimize angry exchanges, and especially, to not direct

your disrespect to anyone.
