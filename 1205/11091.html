Agreed John. Indoor really should have better coverage, and honestly, our lack of publicity is a major contributor to the misperceptions. Last year I finally bit the bullet and started flying F1D only to find that while it is incredibly challenging, it's not half as hard as I'd imagined.
<br />
<br />I'll also say that thanks to the incredible Kang, I've conquered another class this year--EZB. Using Coslick's stiffness specs and Kang's planform and short motorstick, I finally got an EZB that would actually recover from upsets. It was also my first sub-450 mg EZB. Actually, to be more honest, it's lighter than Richmond's. And I'm testing one that's ligher yet.
<br />
<br />Have no fear, I'm not flying EZB at USIC, and Kang's is still lighter anyway.
<br />
<br />Bottom line: perserverance, good designs, and patience really do make the difference. You don't need the good wood either. I don't have any.
<br />
<br />The real question is, do you want to experience the thrill of making a serious model airplane, or are you content to let other folks do it? I for one do not do things because they are easy. Most of the folks who fly indoor are of the same mindset, and no matter how much the classes are watered down, that will not change.
<br />
<br />We're marketing to the wrong audience amongst juniors, too. All of the kids I've had success with are/were homeschooled. They have that &quot;because it's hard&quot; mindset that's needed for a hobbies which push all known limits.
<br />
<br />Good flying,
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A couple of the things that Indoor *does* suffer from is a lack of exposure and, apparently, some misconceptions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; DeLoach shares, at regular intervals, one outsider's perspective.  I don't think it generally representative, but it has some useful bits to it.  We just need to sort the wheat from the chaff. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Saying that Indoor is &quot;unpopular&quot; is, aside from being needlessly mean, pretty wrong.  The dictionary definition of popular is, &quot;regarded with favor, approval, or affection by people in general&quot;.  I haven't met a person yet who wasn't floored by an Indoor model in flight.  Certainly nobody disapproved.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But we are a niche hobby, and we need to continually strive to bring new people into the fold.  More people = more fun.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is fun to have people think that our models are absurdly extreme, and rely on unobtainable materials, but it isn't really true.  I've sneezed while holding a model, and it didn't disintegrate.  I've been on the WC podium 4 times (9, if you include the team category), and my models use OS Film and not-too-difficult-to-find wood.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The various rules aren't generally written in a very precise manner, but I don't see too many examples of events actually being &quot;ruined&quot;.  That doesn't stop some people from talking about them, though.  They love to say &quot;hard&quot;-B, mostly because it makes a nice soundbite (like, &quot;the building is so big it has its own weather system&quot;).  They don't remember to mention that F1L is easier EZB with a weight limit.  It isn't as much fun to say.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A VP on an A-6 is a perfect example of the syndrome.  The fact that nobody has done it yet hasn't prevented it from being used as an example of experts ruining the event.  I don't even think it will work - I don't think the flat blades will have enough pitch range to be valuable.  The only reason to make one would be to tweak DeLoach.  Which, I have to admit, makes it tempting :)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We just need to make an effort to get a positive message out there, to balance out the folklore.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There certainly is a prevailing attitude that Indoor is great.  It would be kind of stupid for us to spend as much time as we do if we thought it wasn't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nobody I know wouldn't like to see it grow, though.  And, as Kang said well, &quot;improve&quot; apparently has different meanings to different people.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not interested in saying anything that could be construed as a &quot;flame&quot;.  The last 7 times this topic has come up is enough.  I actually find DeLoach's ideas motivating.  They make want to get up and prove them wrong :)
