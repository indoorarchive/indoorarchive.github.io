Don: point taken and lots of good reasoning here. And now you're speaking my language...inspiration. 
<br />
<br />One quibble though: am I not part of the indoor community? If not what qualifies one to be a member of the indoor community and therefore have a seat at the table in planning it's future?
<br />
<br />I'd love to see us all embrace the common bond of FREE FLIGHTER. Flying indoors or outdoors is really just incidental.
<br />
<br />Thanks for your many contributions to our hobby. 
<br />
<br />Don DeLoach

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is exactly what should be done. Publicize. Any contest any info, plans etc, publish it. But let the indoor community deal with their own participation issues. And when the indoor community has something that needs to be published then use NFFS to get the word out. You will not get the indoor community inspired by telling them over and over how indoor is broken, wrong, and needs to be fixed etc. Let them worry about it instead of holding it over their heads. How can inspiration and buzzkill happen at the same time?  I rejoined this list as I have had a new inspiration to build my entire fleet since Kent and Michigan. You asked me to write some stuff up on the Kent contest and I did (that is inspiration). I have the USIC schedule out and have selected all events in slots I want to build new models for. So what further inspiration do I read on the list? The NFFS editor telling us what is wrong with indoor ,yet again (buzzkill). We understand the numbers are not what they use to be, and you have made sure we are frequently reminded of it now for many years and we are aware how well outdoor FF is doing and good for them but this is indoor.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps a new yahoo group dedicated to the future of indoor where that can be discussed freely by people who want to discuss that topic in depth and detail.  But I can tell you and any seasoned indoor modeler will tell you that you simply can not make people like indoor. No rule change, no event creation, etc will make people fly indoor. You are either intrigued by it or you are not. I know lots of RC guys (I am in 4 clubs)  and they know about indoor models, they see it in the Model Aviation magazine. I tell some why not build a free flight model, and they are scared of building anything balsa, even a laser cut kit  is viewed as unbuildable. They throw out balsa ARF models with a little wood damage as they don't know how to fix it. Members in my local free flight club refuse to build indoor models. In fact most people at the Kent contest are NOT the local outdoor free flight modelers in the area. They are only interested in FAC outdoor events. Indoor is too delicate they say. So why try to cater to this person? They are not interested no matter what, they have been exposed for years to indoor but have no interest. The best you can do is show people the sport and they     either want to learn more or they do not. I don't think indoor is broken in anyway, I think people are broken instead by instant gratification of Xbox360, cell phones and other technology. Perhaps in indoor Android app :-)  But I think it is possible to promote indoor without having to invoke the use of a prophet of doom.
