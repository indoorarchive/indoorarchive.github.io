Hi Kurt,
<br />
<br />This is very interesting.
<br />
<br />For one thing, it is yet another example of a group figuring out how to provide effective incentive to beginners/newcomers - one that has an achievable initial level and continues on as you (or your dog, in this case) advance.  Neat.
<br />
<br />This is the type of plan we need to implement to lure and hook new participants.
<br />
<br />I consider this to be along the lines of the Pro/Am and the LSF Achievement levels.
<br />
<br />Thanks for sharing it.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       With all this beginner vs expert discussion,  I just wanted to push out a general thought, something that I think the AMA needs to consider in regards to competition.  Recently I have been spending a lot of time training my dog and going to AKC dog competitions, specially Agility.  These are very popular, if I wanted to drive about 3 hours to a competition, I could probably find one every weekend of the year.  They are typically held in large buildings, at least Cat 2 or above sites.  If you don't sign up for an event a month ahead of time, you will not be able to attend, they fill up and typically limited the contestants to a  few hundred.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      Now the AKC has set up the competition in a way that it is not important that you win or come in first, second or third, the importance is that you qualify or Q the event.    Three Q's gets you a title, basically a piece of paper, which doesn't have a lot of value, but has importance to the person that earn it.  There are different classes from Novice to Excellent and in the final class you earn MACH'S and you can earn an unlimited amount of MACHS.   MACH stand for Master Agility Champion which has slightly different rules than the other titles.  To get a Q you need to &quot;pass&quot; the event, perform the course with no or one small mistake and have a time that is reasonable.  A qualifying score is determined by the rules and is dependent on the agility course that day of the event.  The AKC keeps records of all of this and makes lots of money handing out pieces of paper.  An event is held by a local club which also makes a lot of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  money.    As far as I can see everyone wins on the deal, because AKC gives the competitors a better chance of success, many competitors go home proud that they did well, being able to state that they qualified.   They still give out along with a ribbon for qualifying,.... first, second and third ribbons, but the importance is qualifying,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      I personally think if  AMA competition wants to move forward, get more people attending, a system like what the AKC setup should be considered.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just some thought I felt like sharing with others,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My doctor and I were discussing hobbies the other day. I had just returned from another gruelling contest trip and said jokingly that I needed a new hobby. Then I realized that a person (at least most of us) doesn't really get to choose a hobby. Most often what happens its that you see or hear about or in some other way experience an activity that grabs your attention and interest. I think that's how we come to be indoor fliers. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I wanted to actually quit indoor flying I'm sure I could find a way to spend my time, but my hobby is indoor flying and it chose me. I didn't have much to say about the process at all. I for sure didn't get into it because there were vast numbers of other people doing it or because all my neighbors were telling me I should try it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The &quot;experts&quot; vs. &quot;beginners&quot; problem is pretty much the same as in any sport or hobby that you might get involved in. Unless you are Jim Richmond there is always going to be somebody who is better at it than you are. If you're motivated to improve then you will find a way to do so. If you need better wood and work at finding it then you will eventually get some. If your rubber sucks then at some point either you will find someone who is willing to part with some or (hopefully) good rubber might be made again. If you don't understand how to do something you will find people who will explain it to you - even if it takes ten times before you get it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm trying to think of some sort of conclusion to this message but it isn't coming to me so I'm just going to get back to building a new F1L. (if I just had some really good wood.....)
