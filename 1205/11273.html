Ok, so here's my story and some inside details about the Glider NATS of 2012.  First let me say that what makes this hobby so great are the people that are competing with you.  My hat's off to Jon Yost, Tom Batte, Chuck Markos, John Kagan and many others who participated that day.  They all flew great and looked like they were having a great time.   I also need to mention my good friend, 5 time National Champion (last 2 years in UCLG and last 3 years in SCLG) Ralph Ray.  I gained even more respect for Ralph, as a great modeler, a great competitor but most of all as a caring and good friend. 
<br />
     Tuesday morning Ralph, Chris Stoddart and I went to breakfast, then went to the dome and practiced.  Ralph was looking great, his models were beautiful, his launches were perfect and his models glided nicely.  He clearly was ready to retain his National titles.   I was flying well, but felt Ralph was flying better.
<br />
    On Wednesday morning around 3am I woke up with a stomach and lower intestinal problems.  I was visiting the bathroom about every hour.  I got to the dome early and was spending time in washroom.  Ralph asked how I was doing and I told him not well and explained my issues.  I was also getting the sweats and figured it was nerves.   But as a true friend that Ralph is, he gave me this small box with Chinese writing on the side and told me to take it.  I looked at it, opened the box and found a small vial with some small looking brown balls, looked like rabbit turds.  I told him you got to be kidding and he told me no, trust me... down the whole vial.  So I did, about a half hour later I was feeling better and flying.  Since I was worried that my issue might return at any moment, I quickly put up some flights, as it turns out, appears to have been the right thing to do.  I left JC at about 3pm for my ride home and my issues return making my
<br />
&nbsp;drive very long and unpleasant.  
<br />
    Times were not good, but I believe the air was terrible. As the day went on the air appeared to get worse, making any ones chances of turning good times less likely.  My winning times were under 90 seconds in UCLG, under 80 seconds in SCLG and under 70 seconds in HLG.   Well below my past performances at JC.
<br />
<br />Kurt

<br /><br /><br />Kurt, glad to hear my crumbs were correct.
<br />
Once you recover and catch up, I would love to hear more details, scores and such. This was no easy task you achieved, especially with catapult expert Ralph Ray in the house. Good flying!
