This is exactly what should be done. Publicize. Any contest any info, 
<br />
plans etc, publish it. But let the indoor community deal with their own 
<br />
participation issues. And when the indoor community has something that 
<br />
needs to be published then use NFFS to get the word out. You will not 
<br />
get the indoor community inspired by telling them over and over how 
<br />
indoor is broken, wrong, and needs to be fixed etc. Let them worry about 
<br />
it instead of holding it over their heads. How can inspiration and 
<br />
buzzkill happen at the same time?  I rejoined this list as I have had a 
<br />
new inspiration to build my entire fleet since Kent and Michigan. You 
<br />
asked me to write some stuff up on the Kent contest and I did (that is 
<br />
inspiration). I have the USIC schedule out and have selected all events 
<br />
in slots I want to build new models for. So what further inspiration do 
<br />
I read on the list? The NFFS editor telling us what is wrong with indoor 
<br />
,yet again (buzzkill). We understand the numbers are not what they use 
<br />
to be, and you have made sure we are frequently reminded of it now for 
<br />
many years and we are aware how well outdoor FF is doing and good for 
<br />
them but this is indoor.
<br />
<br />Perhaps a new yahoo group dedicated to the future of indoor where that 
<br />
can be discussed freely by people who want to discuss that topic in 
<br />
depth and detail.  But I can tell you and any seasoned indoor modeler 
<br />
will tell you that you simply can not make people like indoor. No rule 
<br />
change, no event creation, etc will make people fly indoor. You are 
<br />
either intrigued by it or you are not. I know lots of RC guys (I am in 4 
<br />
clubs)  and they know about indoor models, they see it in the Model 
<br />
Aviation magazine. I tell some why not build a free flight model, and 
<br />
they are scared of building anything balsa, even a laser cut kit  is 
<br />
viewed as unbuildable. They throw out balsa ARF models with a little 
<br />
wood damage as they don't know how to fix it. Members in my local free 
<br />
flight club refuse to build indoor models. In fact most people at the 
<br />
Kent contest are NOT the local outdoor free flight modelers in the area. 
<br />
They are only interested in FAC outdoor events. Indoor is too delicate 
<br />
they say. So why try to cater to this person? They are not interested no 
<br />
matter what, they have been exposed for years to indoor but have no 
<br />
interest. The best you can do is show people the sport and they either 
<br />
want to learn more or they do not. I don't think indoor is broken in 
<br />
anyway, I think people are broken instead by instant gratification of 
<br />
Xbox360, cell phones and other technology. Perhaps in indoor Android app 
<br />
:-)  But I think it is possible to promote indoor without having to 
<br />
invoke the use of a prophet of doom.
