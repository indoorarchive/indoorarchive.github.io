I think it is easy to talk yourself out of making an F1D. 
<br />
But seriously, it is EASY now compared to how it was in the past. 
<br />

<br />
I made my first one without any help from anyone. No mentor at all. 
<br />
I found the equation for a prop block in the little white book by Lew Gitlow (all that was out at the time, minus a few plans in Model Aviation), grabbed a 2x4 and started hacking at it with an axe. Literally.
<br />

<br />
Things were slightly simpler as my local hobby shop carried Micro-X supplies. So I had access to nichrome wire and wood and microfilm. I poured it the first time in my bathtub. My parents are still pissed about that to hear them tell the story. 
<br />

<br />
I figured it out at age 16. And my planes flew ok. 
<br />
Later on I met the locals, Doig and Shailor and others whose names have faded into the cobwebs of distant memory. 
<br />

<br />
When I got back into it, I just wanted to fly them. No real thought of competing either. For me, the only person I really want to compete against is... Myself. I want to beat my best time. And if I beat others in the process, that's OK, but that isn't really the point for me. I'm not super competitive that way. I may never make the US team. Shrug. Fine by me. If I can continue flying and trying new things and experimenting and getting better, it will all be worth it for me. 
<br />

<br />
Nothing is stopping you from joining me or us or your local group. 
<br />
It's OK to take F1D up because you find it fun or relaxing or just plain cool. 
<br />
In many ways, it has never been easier than now.
<br />

<br />
Regards.
<br />
