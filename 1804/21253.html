It seems the answer to the BOM question might not lie in resolving it but
<br />
in giving each side a place. Two events. One, BOM only, the other supported
<br />
by paid makers. Which would be an FAI event? Vacillate, try one, then the
<br />
other. There's no hurry. Make it interesting. Opinions never  . . . well, .
<br />
. .
<br />
<br />As far as attracting more builders and an approach to high tech, make an
<br />
event for the old non-carbon, non-boron, balsa and tungsten F1D. It's
<br />
interesting to note that golf's Masters tournament had less that 100
<br />
qualify for this year's event. How many, from how many countries made it to
<br />
French Lick?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Don,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I usually have exchanges like this privately rather than on a public
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forum.  However, the BOM issue is much too important not do have everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; said and done publicly and in the most transparent way possible.  I had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hoped that after nearly a week of reflection you might come you understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that dismissive and incendiary replies or posts add nothing to your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; publicly stated desire &quot;to thoughtfully consider the Builder of the Model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rule.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a previous reply, I brought up the concern that  your assertions about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how free flighters (I hope you were referring to indoor models rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all modelers) would rather fly than build and how indoor Free flight was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shrinking relative to other model aircraft flying were not accompanied by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supporting data.  In this reply, I would like to discuss directly the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposed BOM rule elimination.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are actually two different discussions of the BOM rules taking place
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at this time.  One, brought about by the  use of purchased vp hubs at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recent Indoor World Championships, is concerned with the where and how to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; draw the line between model parts and components that can be purchased and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; used in the construction of a model and those which must be made by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modeler.  I suspect that it will be very difficult to find more than just a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; few indoor modelers who want to completely do away with the BOM rule for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indoor rubber powered models.  Even with the AMA's more exact BOM wording,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the line is not clear at all, especially for FAI class models.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, your proposed AMA rule change goes all the way in eliminating the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BOM rule for the recently enacted P18 class.  We have not even gone one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rules cycle without your proposing a major change to that class that has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not yet had time to its growth potential.  And, the reasons given for not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having the BOM rule for this class are already being used for indoor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contests during the last decade.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since 2010 or so, the Indoor Nats has had available the LPP Pro-Am event
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where LPP's are loaned out (and sometime given away) to beginning fliers to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fly.  At the last two Nats, P18 kits were given away, a building program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was held, and the models were flown by junior age fliers.  Furthermore,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ever since I started flying AMA contest in April of 2010, models and parts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have always been loaned to for other to try and fly.  As you well know,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kang and I loaned out our SO models during our very first AMa contest at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tustin to junior (and some older) who wanted to try indoor flying.  In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact, at all nearly all AMA contests I have attended, people were allowed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and even encouraged to fly with models or parts they had not built
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves.  The BOM rule did not keep people (who did not build for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever reason) from flying.  The only restriction was that such flight
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times did not count in the scores or for records.  So, it is not at all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obvious that the BOM rule is keeping people out of indoor flying as anyone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and everyone can still actually fly indoor models.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I also think it unwise to take what is called, by the proposers of the P18
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; class, a beginners' class, any reward for building the model on one's own.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question we should all be asking is if we want to keep craftsmanship as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a  necessary part of our indoor programs.  Some think that this is part of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what makes the sport of indoor flying something special.  Going back to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first discussion of the line to be drawn by the BOM rule, that is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question of what level of craftsmanship and building is sufficient to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; preserve that part of our sport.  I like to compare this to the Jedi
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; training in the Star Wars movie sagas.  A vp hub is thought by some to be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rite-of-passage for competing (notice that I say competing, not flying) in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; three of the four FAI rubber powered classes.  This is similar to one of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the final tests before a trainee becomes a Jedi Knight.  One of the final
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trials, was for the trainee to build his own light saber.  Some in our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indoor sport feel this way about vp hubs.  Some do not.  But few, if any,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think that personal craftsmanship should not be a component of the sport.
