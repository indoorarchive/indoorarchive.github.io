It has already been shown that one can do 27 minutes in F1D with TSS 
<br />
rubber at Lakehurst. So if flight performance is less than that on TSS 
<br />
then rubber is not the reason. 5/99 will not take a 20 minute F1D and 
<br />
make it a 27 minute F1D. It is becoming an easy excuse to say it is bad 
<br />
rubber (like a golfer blaming their clubs) but TSS is not as bad as 
<br />
people make it out to be. Rubber back when 5/99 was being made had large 
<br />
differences in batches. I went from 41 to 48 minutes in 65cm F1D from 
<br />
better batches of rubber but batches then could vary 20%. Since the 6/16 
<br />
TSS batch, I tested several batches of TSS as they came out for about a 
<br />
year or so after. All TSS batches were within 1-2% of each other, I was 
<br />
rather surprised with the quality control over a year span of batches. I 
<br />
lent some TSS to a guy at the Nats a few years back and he beat me in 
<br />
A-6 and I was using &quot;good&quot; rubber.Â  I personally do not think it is 
<br />
beneficial thinking your so far behind the 8 ball its hopeless. There is 
<br />
a lot of things to learn to get to 27 minutes first in F1D, then one can 
<br />
start complaining they don't have good rubber :-)

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My interest in F1D is due to living in an area where a few high level

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; competitors fly, Ross Clements and the Szczur's, Steve Fujikawa and a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; few more who do everything possible to encourage involvement. But at

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the end of the day, effort and money won't overcome inferior rubber or

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wood, when flights are measure in thousands of seconds and a 1%

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; performance improvement can mean an easy win. I know equipment alone

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dedication and experience can only overcome so much. Even if there is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another batch of rubber that can equal 5/99, choosing it and figuring 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out how to get enough out of it to equal or beat 5/99 is just one more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impediment to growing the sport.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the answer to that is self evident but no one seems willing to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talk about it, much less change rules.
