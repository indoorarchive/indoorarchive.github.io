Hello District IX Indoor Free Flighters,
<br />
<br />It's rule change season again! There are four proposals I'm required to 
<br />
vote on this cycle: Three General AMA Rules proposals and one Indoor FF 
<br />
proposal. I've attached the proposal summaries below. Please read 
<br />
through them carefully and let me know how you'd like me to vote and 
<br />
most of all, why. My ballot is due to AMA HQ by 5/1/18.
<br />
<br />Thanks
<br />
Don DeLoach
<br />
IFFCB District IX
<br />
<br />P.S. Club leaders: Please forward to any and all AMA member FFers who 
<br />
reside in Wyoming, Nebraska, North Dakota, Kansas, Colorado or South Dakota.
<br />
<br /><br />19-01 (Proposer: Jerry Murphy)
<br />
<br />General Section
<br />
<br />SUMMARY:
<br />
AMA General rules page 21 Records Section 3 states:
<br />
When the specifications of a model, the method of timing, and the 
<br />
conditions of flight comply with the rules of more than one class or 
<br />
category, such model with a single flight (or single series of flights) 
<br />
may establish national records in more than one class or category if the 
<br />
performance exceeds the existing records. Responsibility for applying 
<br />
for national records rests with the flier and Contest Director
<br />
<br />EXACT PROPOSED WORDING:
<br />
Page 21 Section 3 Multiple Records
<br />
National records can be established for only a single class or category 
<br />
declared in advance before any flights are recorded.
<br />
<br />LOGIC BEHIND PROPOSED CHANGE. STATE INTENT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE:
<br />
The present rule implies that a competitor could apply the performance 
<br />
recorded in one class or category to additional classes or categories as 
<br />
well even though the competitor logged no performance in the other class 
<br />
or category. An example could be a contestant flying E-36 records a 
<br />
total score greater than the winner of AMA A Electric. The contestant 
<br />
then tells the contest director to apply his E-36 times to the A 
<br />
Electric even though no flights were flown in that class and be declared 
<br />
the winner, and a possible National Record as well. This same situation 
<br />
could arise in AMA gas and AMA Classic classes or catagories.
<br />
<br />EFFECT IF ANY ON CURRENT AMA RECORDS:
<br />
No effect on current records. Any current records currently on the books 
<br />
should remain as it will be difficult to determine which of any records 
<br />
were set this way.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />GEN 19-02 (Proposer: Don Slusarscyk)
<br />
<br />General Section
<br />
<br />SUMMARY:
<br />
To allow each individual Contest Board the ability to decide if they 
<br />
will continue or discontinue the practice of setting multiple records 
<br />
with one flight. This proposal adds paragraph 3.2 to the General Rules 
<br />
&quot;Records&quot; section (page 22). Paragraph 3.1 is the current wording and is 
<br />
unchanged.
<br />
<br />EXACT PROPOSED WORDING:
<br />
3. Multiple Records
<br />
3.1. When the specifications of a model, the method of timing, and the 
<br />
conditions of flight comply with the rules of more than one class or 
<br />
category, such model with a single flight (or single series of flights) 
<br />
may establish national records in more than one class or category if the 
<br />
performance exceeds the existing records. Responsibility for applying 
<br />
for national records rests with the flier and Contest Director.
<br />
3.2. Individual Contest Boards with record setting classes, by default, 
<br />
will permit the setting of multiple records as specified in 3.1. 
<br />
Individual Contest Boards may restrict or prohibit the setting
<br />
of multiple records for specific classes or categories by means of the 
<br />
Competition Regulations for those classes.
<br />
<br />LOGIC BEHIND PROPOSED CHANGE. STATE INTENT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE:
<br />
For at least 49 years (based on available published AMA rule books) the 
<br />
AMA has allowed a model that fits multiple classes to set multiple 
<br />
national records with one flight. This was most importantly true when I 
<br />
was a Junior setting my first indoor National records as I was able to 
<br />
set multiple records with one flight with a model that fit the rules of 
<br />
two classes. Presently there are still standing Indoor FF national 
<br />
records that were set in this way and some Indoor FF classes were 
<br />
intentionally created to allow this overlap to occur.
<br />
<br />Because of a recent General Rules proposal that wants prohibit this long 
<br />
standing practice, it has become evident that various modeling 
<br />
disciplines may intentionally or unintentionally become affected by such 
<br />
a General Rules changes. Due to the way voting is done on a General 
<br />
Rules changes, it is possible that a rule change may pass even though 
<br />
one specific contest board votes unanimously against the proposal. This 
<br />
essentially allows other Contest Boards to alter the rules of a board 
<br />
they are not a member of.
<br />
<br />This rules proposal allows each affected Contest Board to decide on 
<br />
their own if they wish to continue or discontinue the multiple records 
<br />
practice based on the needs of their specific sport. This proposal by 
<br />
default will keep the rules exactly the same as they have been for 49+ 
<br />
years. So for those Contest Boards that are content with the multi 
<br />
records practice, nothing else further needs to be done after adopting 
<br />
this proposal. For those Contest Boards that would prefer to restrict or 
<br />
discontinue the multi records practice, this proposal adds a pathway for 
<br />
those Contest Boards to make those changes by means of their Competition 
<br />
Regulations.
<br />
<br />EFFECT IF ANY ON CURRENT AMA RECORDS:
<br />
No effect on current records
<br />
<br /><br /><br />GEN19-03 (Proposed by: Don DeLoach)
<br />
<br />General Section
<br />
<br />SUMMARY:
<br />
Change requirement in General Rules that AMA Record Trials require only 
<br />
one timekeeper for record attempts.
<br />
<br />EXACT PROPOSED WORDING:
<br />
Change on page 21 of General Rules from &quot;The CD must satisfy himself 
<br />
that every applicable AMA regulation has been complied with. Where a 
<br />
record is established at a record trial and involves a timed flight, the 
<br />
record time must be the average of times recorded by two (2) timers 
<br />
holding valid AMA licenses. The record applicant and the CD may not 
<br />
serve as timers.&quot;
<br />
<br />to
<br />
<br />&quot;The CD must satisfy himself that every applicable AMA regulation has 
<br />
been complied with. Where a record is established at a record trial and 
<br />
involves a timed flight, the record time must be recorded by any single 
<br />
timekeeper who holds an AMA license. The record applicant and the CD may 
<br />
not serve as timers.&quot;
<br />
<br />LOGIC BEHIND PROPOSED CHANGE. STATE INTENT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE:
<br />
Currently National Records may be set at any sanctioned A through AAAA 
<br />
contest with a single timekeeper, but Record Trials require two 
<br />
timekeepers. This is illogical and inconsistent.
<br />
<br />EFFECT IF ANY ON CURRENT AMA RECORDS:
<br />
none
<br />
<br /><br /><br />IFF19-03 (Proposed by: Don DeLoach)
<br />
<br />SUMMARY:
<br />
Removes 'Builder of Model' requirement for event 227 (P-18). State exact 
<br />
wording proposed for the Competition Regulations. List paragraph number 
<br />
where applicable. Example: Change &quot;quote present rule book wording&quot; to 
<br />
&quot;exact wording required&quot;. 25. P-18 Provisional (for event 227) 25.7 The 
<br />
'Builder of the Model' rule (AMA General Rules, section 10 part 6) shall 
<br />
not apply to P-18.
<br />
<br />LOGIC BEHIND PROPOSED CHANGE. STATE INTENT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE:
<br />
The time is right for the AMA Indoor Contest Board to thoughtfully 
<br />
consider the Builder of the Model. The simple fact is that a significant 
<br />
number of Free Flighters would much rather fly than build. Amid an ever 
<br />
changing (and in many cases growing) world of varied model aircraft 
<br />
flying, I'm afraid Indoor FF will just continue to shrink unless we try 
<br />
some new ideas. In short, we could very well be missing out on 
<br />
opportunities to grow Indoor.
<br />
<br />My proposal would only eliminate BoM for P-18. This seems like a 
<br />
low-risk event in which to gauge interest in non-BoM indoor flying. No 
<br />
records would be affected since P-18 is Provisional. I envision clubs 
<br />
having a stock of RTF P-18s to lend out to prospective flyers at flying 
<br />
events, and even given away. This has been tried with considerable 
<br />
success in Outdoor FF since the BoM was dropped wholesale about 10 years ago
<br />
<br />EFFECT IF ANY ON CURRENT AMA RECORDS:
<br />
none
