I thought about a tools intro. This sounds like a similarly good idea.

<br />Thanks Mike.  It's awfully difficult to get out of Ohio for Science Olympiad.  Too many top-level teams here.  We will try our best.  
<br />
​I really like the YouTube channel idea.  I have watched some videos by Joshua Finn already.  He's very informative, but there are some basics that I feel are missing.  For example, he shows how to roll motorstick tubes.  That's useful, but I don't know where to get that thin C-grain ultra-light-density balsa wood sheets and where to get tapered mandrels either.  I have a copy of Ron William's book &quot;Building &amp; Flying Indoor Model Airplanes&quot; and I've read through a lot of INAV newsletters, but it's still difficult to just get started.  Maybe a series of videos on how to build an F1D plane (or even an introductory type not as difficult) from start to finish that would include where to get the wood and other materials.  
<br />
Thanks,
<br />
David.

<br />&nbsp;    Dave,
<br />
You are exactly the (type of) person I was aiming at with my YouTube channel idea.
<br />
Ask a question. You'll see some answers and potentially a video to cover the topic. 
<br />
And if at all possible, bring them to the NATS this year. I'd love to help!
<br />
<br />Regards.Mike Kirda

<br />Hi,
<br />
I've been listening in on the discussions for a while now.  I coach the Wright Stuff event for Science Olympiad at a middle school in Centerville, OH (near Dayton, OH).  Last year, I grew interested in learning how to build and fly F1D planes and have been stoking interest in the kids I coach as well.  The problem for us is that we don't really have anyone to teach us how to do anything here.  We have learned so much on our own and from some help online, but even our 7g Wright Stuff planes are not exceptional.  We have done very controlled experiments with changing propeller pitch, changing rubber thickness (as measured by linear density), and even changing to flared propellers we build ourselves.   Nothing seems to boost our performance into the next level. 
<br />
Another local team does have help from someone who has mentored students in F1D before.  In fact, one of those students was on the US Junior F1D team at the World Championship in Romania some years back.  However, that person does not want to compromise the ability of the middle school team he coaches to beat up on everyone else in the flying events so he is understandably reluctant us.  It appears to me that to get into F1D is enormously difficult without serious mentoring.  We are nowhere near the point of needing top-level rubber, but some of the kids and I would like to get into F1D this Summer after the Science Olympiad competition season is over.   Of course, we would like to improve our times in Wright Stuff as well.

<br /><br />&nbsp;   One of the hurdles to becoming a serious contender in F1D isacquiring the tools and materials necessary. Some of these resources are available, though obscure – requiring ascavenger hunt to locate and collect the bits and pieces.  Others are more of a challenge, such astools that are no longer being machined or materials no longer in production.
<br />
 5/99 rubber falls in the latter category.  It alone will not catapult an average flyerto the top ranks.  In fact, there isonly a marginal difference between it and other top batches, including the mostrecent Super Sport vintages.  But, wheneverything else in your program has been refined, a small improvement can make adifference. A batch of 5/99 from anonymous source was brought to myattention, and I decided to put together a program around it.  The goal is to promote F1D in the US, andsupport new and existing US F1D participants. A patron, who also wishes to remain anonymous, was willingto front funds to purchase the rubber. Approved candidates will be given the opportunity topurchase rubber, with the proceeds used to repay the patron.  Successful candidates will demonstrate botha need for the rubber and an aptitude and significant interest in F1D.  The goal is to provide an incentive forparticipating in F1D, as well as to help develop and support promising US F1Dflyers. The cost will be $200/lb, plus postage as applicable, inincrements between 1/4 to 1/2 lbs.  Theintention is to balance “distributing the rubber to worthy candidates” with“stretching the supply as long as possible”. Please bring candidates to my attention.  The US F1D Team Selection Committee will voteon candidates, with a simple majority of voting members required for approval. The Team Selection committee is being used only as a convenientvoting group.  This 5/99 rubber programis not part of the US Team Selection program, and is not &quot;team rubber&quot;.   The patron reserves the right to cancel the program and selloff the remaining rubber to minimize losses if, for example, a new superiorbatch of rubber become imminent. Thanks,John
