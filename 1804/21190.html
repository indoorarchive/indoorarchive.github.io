One of the hurdles to becoming a serious contender in F1D is acquiring the tools and materials necessary.  Some of these resources are available, though obscure – requiring a scavenger hunt to locate and collect the bits and pieces.  Others are more of a challenge, such as tools that are no longer being machined or materials no longer in production.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;5/99 rubber falls in the latter category.  It alone will not catapult an average flyer to the top ranks.  In fact, there is only a marginal difference between it and other top batches, including the most recent Super Sport vintages.  But, when everything else in your program has been refined, a small improvement can make a difference.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;A batch of 5/99 from anonymous source was brought to my attention, and I decided to put together a program around it.  The goal is to promote F1D in the US, and support new and existing US F1D participants.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;A patron, who also wishes to remain anonymous, was willing to front funds to purchase the rubber.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Approved candidates will be given the opportunity to purchase rubber, with the proceeds used to repay the patron.  Successful candidates will demonstrate both a need for the rubber and an aptitude and significant interest in F1D.  The goal is to provide an incentive for participating in F1D, as well as to help develop and support promising US F1D flyers.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;The cost will be $200/lb, plus postage as applicable, in increments between 1/4 to 1/2 lbs.  The intention is to balance “distributing the rubber to worthy candidates” with “stretching the supply as long as possible”.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Please bring candidates to my attention.  The US F1D Team Selection Committee will vote on candidates, with a simple majority of voting members required for approval.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;The Team Selection committee is being used only as a convenient voting group.  This 5/99 rubber program is not part of the US Team Selection program, and is not &quot;team rubber&quot;.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;The patron reserves the right to cancel the program and sell off the remaining rubber to minimize losses if, for example, a new superior batch of rubber become imminent.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Thanks,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;John
<br />
