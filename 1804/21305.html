Mike,
<br />
I never said anything about not flying F1D merely that I considered  competition a more uphill battle than I'd like due to the unavailability of 5/99. I agree that building is easier than ever before.
<br />

<br />
I actually got into indoor endurance because I had lost my &quot;soft&quot; hands building IMAC birds but have for the last 15 years been pursuing F3P and somewhat like F1D it now takes a pretty serious commitment to  have a competitive plane.
<br />
&nbsp;That recently changed with people having success with balsa instead of carbon fiber and also with retirement I had the time to build my own coaxial drive which means I dont have to pay $500 per plane for a motor/prop system. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;So knowing I would be building a huge plane with only 1/32&quot; wood, I started building endurance planes to get back the &quot;soft&quot; touch. It did not take long to realize the silly little rubber band planes were in reality complex and difficult to master wonders of design and performance. So starting as a means to an end(F3P) I've become fascinated with them and after a couple of A6's find the building of more challenging (mini and micro sticks)planes easier than I expected. So its time to move up(F1L and EZB first). A fellow flier seeing my enthusiasm,  gifted me a Salt F1D that the builder has retired having built better examples. Again, playing around with it in my living room has proven to be too infectious to not pursue getting involved.
<br />

<br />
Who knows, maybe in a year or two someone will take pity on  me and I'll end up with some first rate rubber.<br />
