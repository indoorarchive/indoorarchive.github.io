<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It has already been shown that one can do 27 minutes in F1D with TSS rubber at Lakehurst. So if flight performance is less than that on TSS then rubber is not the reason. 5/99 will not take a 20 minute F1D and make it a 27 minute F1D. It is becoming an easy excuse to say it is bad rubber (like a golfer blaming their clubs) but TSS is not as bad as people make it out to be. Rubber back when 5/99 was being made had large differences in batches. I went from 41 to 48 minutes in 65cm F1D from better batches of rubber but batches then could vary 20%. Since the 6/16 TSS batch, I tested several batches of TSS as they came out for about a year or so after. All TSS batches were within 1-2% of each other, I was rather surprised with the quality control over a year span of batches. I lent some TSS to a guy at the Nats a few years back and he beat me in A-6 and I was using &quot;good&quot; rubber.  I personally do not think it is beneficial thinking your so far behind the 8 ball its hopeless. There is a lot of things to learn to get to 27 minutes first in F1D, then one can start complaining they don't have good rubber :-)

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I presume this idea is partially based on the supply being smaller than possible demand. I think if that is the case its a fair way to support talent but the other side of the coin is its why the sport is not as popular as it could be.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I for one will be flying F1D but with NO thought of competing precisely because of the existence of un-obtainium rubber and wood. I would love to compete but not with a stacked deck of equipment, its bad enough to see how a few names dominate because of decades of involvement and experience, its not realistic to think one can play catch up AND overcome flying with less than the best power and materials.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; My interest in F1D is due to living in an area where a few high level competitors fly, Ross Clements and the Szczur's, Steve Fujikawa and a few more who do everything possible to encourage involvement. But at the end of the day, effort and money won't overcome inferior rubber or wood, when flights are measure in thousands of seconds and a 1% performance improvement can mean an easy win. I know equipment alone does not making winning performance, but I also know talent, dedication and experience can only overcome so much. Even if there is another batch of rubber that can equal 5/99, choosing it and figuring out how to get enough out of it to equal or beat 5/99 is just one more impediment to growing the sport.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think the answer to that is self evident but no one seems willing to talk about it, much less change rules.
