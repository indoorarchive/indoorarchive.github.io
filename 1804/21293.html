I presume this idea is partially based on the supply being smaller than possible demand. I think if that is the case its a fair way to support talent but the other side of the coin is its why the sport is not as popular as it could be. 
<br />

<br />
I for one will be flying F1D but with NO thought of competing precisely because of the existence of un-obtainium rubber and wood. I would love to compete but not with a stacked deck of equipment, its bad enough to see how a few names dominate because of decades of involvement and experience, its not realistic to think one can play catch up AND overcome flying with less than the best power and materials.
<br />

<br />
My interest in F1D is due to living in an area where a few high level competitors fly, Ross Clements and the Szczur's, Steve Fujikawa and a few more who do everything possible to encourage involvement. But at the end of the day, effort and money won't overcome inferior rubber or wood, when flights are measure in thousands of seconds and a 1% performance improvement can mean an easy win. I know equipment alone does not making winning performance, but I also know talent, dedication and experience can only overcome so much. Even if there is another batch of rubber that can equal 5/99, choosing it and figuring out how to get enough out of it to equal or beat 5/99 is just one more impediment to growing the sport.
<br />
I think the answer to that is self evident but no one seems willing to talk about it, much less change rules.<br />
