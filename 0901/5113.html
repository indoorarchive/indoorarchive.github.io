Hi,
<br />
     I suggest the following:
<br />
 
<br />
1)  More positive wing incidence.  
<br />
2)  A larger horizontal stab.  
<br />
 
<br />
Now if the model wings are flexing once the nose gets down you can also stiffen  those spars up by running thin CA glue around the spar.  
<br />
 
<br />
Good Luck,
<br />
 
<br />
Kurt
<br />

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hi all:
<br />
<br />I have coached Wright Stuff in Science Olympiad for several years. 
<br />
Many of you have helped me to become a novice expert, at least at the 
<br />
Wright Stuff level. Thank you.
<br />
<br />I need some input.
<br />
<br />I have a team of sixth graders that have built a descent Wright Stuff 
<br />
plane. It is near minimum weight. At first it had motor stick 
<br />
bending issues, but those have been completely solved with the 
<br />
addition of a truss, similar to that sometimes used on F1D planes 
<br />
only made of balsa tension members instead of wire.
<br />
<br />The the plane would &quot;mush&quot; or literally descend in a flat horizontal 
<br />
attidue five feet during the descent phase of the flight, but only 
<br />
after a nice climb and cruise. This was solved by moving the CG 
<br />
forward.
<br />
<br />The final problem happens when the plane has a head on collision. For 
<br />
example, if it hits a beam or a curtain it momentarily stops and 
<br />
dives like all indoor free flight rubber powered planes, but instead 
<br />
of recovering and resuming flight in a nice level attitude, it 
<br />
continues to rapidly descent at an angle of about thirty degrees, 
<br />
until it crashes. Two bent prop shafts have resulted. 
<br />
<br />The main wing is 14 cm in chord by 40 cm in span, which comes out to 
<br />
about a 35% aspect ratio. The inside wing panel is slightly longer 
<br />
and the wing has about 1/8 inch wash in on the inboard trailing 
<br />
edge. I estimate that the CG is about 2 3/4 inches forward of the 
<br />
trailing edge of the main wing. Camber is about 6% on the ribs. 
<br />
<br />My guess is that failure of the plane to recover is due to the 
<br />
leading edge spar not being stiff enough, and that once the plane is 
<br />
nose down, the main wing changes shape so that all lift is lost. 
<br />
These are just sixth graders so the leading edge is just square 
<br />
balsa. It is 40 cm long and is made of 1/16&quot; square balsa. I seem to 
<br />
recall that this spar weighed about 0.30 grams. It did not seem too 
<br />
floppy when selected. Total weight of the wing, including tooth pick 
<br />
(bass wood) wing posts (hard for the sixth graders to break them), is 
<br />
approximately 1.70 grams. 
<br />
<br />My proposed fix it to glue a 1/8&quot; by 1/16&quot; by 40 cm piece with a 
<br />
triangular cross-section to the leading edge to reinforce the same 
<br />
and provide a better airfoil cross section at the same time. This 
<br />
piece weighs about 0.30 grams and seems relatively stiff, or at least 
<br />
as stiff as the existing leading edge spar to which it will be glued. 
<br />
They can switch to a lighter plastic prop which has worked well in 
<br />
the past, and still be around 7.0 grams, which is the minimum weight 
<br />
allowed under the 2009 Wright Stuff rules. 
<br />
<br />Do you have any thoughts about what may be causing the dive and 
<br />
failure to recover, and any proposed fixes? There probably isn't 
<br />
enough time before the Wright Stuff competition for the sixth graders 
<br />
to build a new wing. Like almost all Wright Stuff teams, we have 
<br />
extremely limited access to the gym for flying. It seems like there 
<br />
is basketball 24/7.
<br />
<br />Thanks in advance for your suggestions.
