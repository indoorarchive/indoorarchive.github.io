I think there's a good chance your analysis is correct. The quickest way to stiffen the spar would be to glue another thin piece of wood to the bottom of the spar. If I remember correctly the bending strength goes up by either the 3rd or 4th power of the depth. Watch the TE also. A too weak trailing edge can flare upward causing the LE to tuck under. I like for both spars to be equal in deflection. You can measure this during construction and you can also observe it during flight.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: [Indoor_Construction] plane won't recover after collision
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi all:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I have coached Wright Stuff in Science Olympiad for several years. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of you have helped me to become a novice expert, at least at the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wright Stuff level. Thank you.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I need some input.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a team of sixth graders that have built a descent Wright Stuff 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;plane. It is near minimum weight. At first it had motor stick 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;bending issues, but those have been completely solved with the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;addition of a truss, similar to that sometimes used on F1D planes 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;only made of balsa tension members instead of wire.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The the plane would &quot;mush&quot; or literally descend in a flat horizontal 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;attidue five feet during the descent phase of the flight, but only 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;after a nice climb and cruise. This was solved by moving the CG 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;forward.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The final problem happens when the plane has a head on collision. For 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;example, if it hits a beam or a curtain it momentarily stops and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;dives like all indoor free flight rubber powered planes, but instead 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of recovering and resuming flight in a nice level attitude, it 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;continues to rapidly descent at an angle of about thirty degrees, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;until it crashes. Two bent prop shafts have resulted. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The main wing is 14 cm in chord by 40 cm in span, which comes out to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;about a 35% aspect ratio. The inside wing panel is slightly longer 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and the wing has about 1/8 inch wash in on the inboard trailing 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;edge. I estimate that the CG is about 2 3/4 inches forward of the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;trailing edge of the main wing. Camber is about 6% on the ribs. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My guess is that failure of the plane to recover is due to the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;leading edge spar not being stiff enough, and that once the plane is 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;nose down, the main wing changes shape so that all lift is lost. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;These are just sixth graders so the leading edge is just square 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;balsa. It is 40 cm long and is made of 1/16&quot; square balsa. I seem to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;recall that this spar weighed about 0.30 grams. It did not seem too 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;floppy when selected. Total weight of the wing, including tooth pick 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(bass wood) wing posts (hard for the sixth graders to break them), is 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;approximately 1.70 grams. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My proposed fix it to glue a 1/8&quot; by 1/16&quot; by 40 cm piece with a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;triangular cross-section to the leading edge to reinforce the same 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and provide a better airfoil cross section at the same time. This 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;piece weighs about 0.30 grams and seems relatively stiff, or at least 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;as stiff as the existing leading edge spar to which it will be glued. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;They can switch to a lighter plastic prop which has worked well in 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the past, and still be around 7.0 grams, which is the minimum weight 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;allowed under the 2009 Wright Stuff rules. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have any thoughts about what may be causing the dive and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;failure to recover, and any proposed fixes? There probably isn't 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;enough time before the Wright Stuff competition for the sixth graders 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to build a new wing. Like almost all Wright Stuff teams, we have 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;extremely limited access to the gym for flying. It seems like there 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is basketball 24/7.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks in advance for your suggestions.
<br />
