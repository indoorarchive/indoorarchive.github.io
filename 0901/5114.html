<br />
Hi all:
<br />
<br />I have coached Wright Stuff in Science Olympiad for several years.
<br />
Many of you have helped me to become a novice expert, at least at the
<br />
Wright Stuff level. Thank you.
<br />
<br />I need some input.
<br />
<br />I have a team of sixth graders that have built a decent Wright Stuff
<br />
plane. It is near minimum weight. At first it had motor stick
<br />
bending issues, but those have been completely solved with the
<br />
addition of a truss, similar to that sometimes used on F1D planes
<br />
only made of balsa tension members instead of wire.
<br />
<br />Then the plane would &quot;mush&quot; or literally descend in a flat horizontal
<br />
attidue five feet during the descent phase of the flight, but only
<br />
after a nice climb and cruise. This was solved by moving the CG
<br />
forward.
<br />
<br />The final problem happens when the plane has a head on collision. For
<br />
example, if it hits a beam or a curtain it momentarily stops and
<br />
dives like all indoor free flight rubber powered planes, but instead
<br />
of recovering and resuming flight in a nice level attitude, it
<br />
continues to rapidly descent at an angle of about thirty degrees,
<br />
until it crashes. Two bent prop shafts have resulted.
<br />
<br />The main wing is 14 cm in chord by 40 cm in span, which comes out to
<br />
about a 35% aspect ratio. The inside wing panel is slightly longer
<br />
and the wing has about 1/8 inch wash in on the inboard trailing
<br />
edge. I estimate that the CG is about 2 3/4 inches forward of the
<br />
trailing edge of the main wing. Camber is about 6% on the ribs. The
<br />
wing has flat tip plates, which are pretty large. So the main section
<br />
of the wing has straight LE and TE spars and the tip plates are
<br />
vertical. My seventh graders (second Wright Stuff team I am
<br />
coaching) are getting very good times with their planes of similar
<br />
design, with none of the problems described in this post. They were
<br />
smart enough to build two planes.
<br />
<br />My guess is that failure of the sixth grader's plane to recover is
<br />
due to the leading edge spar not being stiff enough, and that once
<br />
the plane is nose down, the main wing changes shape so that all lift
<br />
is lost. These are just sixth graders so the leading edge is made of
<br />
square balsa and not some fancy cross-section. The LE spar is 40 cm
<br />
long and is made of 1/16&quot; square balsa. I seem to recall that this
<br />
spar weighed about 0.30 grams. It did not seem too floppy when
<br />
selected. Total weight of the wing, including tooth pick (bass wood)
<br />
wing posts (hard for the sixth graders to break them), is
<br />
approximately 1.70 grams.
<br />
<br />My proposed fix it to glue a 1/8&quot; by 1/16&quot; by 40 cm piece with a
<br />
triangular cross-section to the leading edge to reinforce the same
<br />
and provide a better airfoil cross section at the same time. This
<br />
piece weighs about 0.22 grams and seems relatively stiff, or at least
<br />
as stiff as the existing leading edge spar to which it will be glued.
<br />
They can switch to a lighter plastic prop which has worked well in
<br />
the past, and still be around 7.0 grams, which is the minimum weight
<br />
allowed under the 2009 Wright Stuff rules.
<br />
<br />Do you have any thoughts about what may be causing the dive and
<br />
failure to recover, and any proposed fixes? There probably isn't
<br />
enough time before the Wright Stuff competition for the sixth graders
<br />
to build a new wing. Like almost all Wright Stuff teams, we have
<br />
extremely limited access to the gym for flying. It seems like there
<br />
is basketball 24/7.
<br />
<br />Thanks in advance for your suggestions.
