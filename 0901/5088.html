Hi,
<br />
    I basically agree with John comments below.  I think people do try, they are donating their time (usually their flying time) to run or help run the events and over the years have done a great job.  I try to thank them every time I can.  The AMA and NFFS also contributes to this effort and does a good job, we should appreciate this.  
<br />
    Now things are not perfect and it could be better.  If one really feels strongly it should be better then they should put in whatever time it takes to accomplish this.   I am not aware of everyone trying to stop someone from doing some work and making things better.   
<br />
   Let's be constructive and do what we can to make this a great event.  
<br />
 
<br />
Cheers,
<br />
 
<br />
Kurt

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I feel like there is no organization in the United States that is

interested in indoor freeflight at this point in time.
<br />
<br />Having been 1/3 of the USIC operation team for the last three years, 
<br />
I can attest that the interest in the Indoor FF Nats goes something 
<br />
like this:
<br />
<br />- The AMA relegates the operation of the Indoor FF Nats to our 
<br />
SIG, NFFS (which really isn't a bad thing at all)
<br />
- NFFS procures a rube (or three, in our case) to spend a lot 
<br />
of time making sure the event goes smoothly instead of getting to fly 
<br />
themselves.
<br />
- The rube, er…Event Director makes the choices that he or she 
<br />
feels is best
<br />
<br />In our case, we automated the scoring system, created a time-
<br />
proportional schedule chart, eliminated the fill-in-your- times-
<br />
yourself easels, adjusted the table layout to ease the pain of the 
<br />
scoreboard, announced awards over the PA without stopping the 
<br />
activities, included some new events, figured out how to legally 
<br />
allow an Event Director to fly some events, ran a fundraising raffle, 
<br />
etc. Hopefully people liked more of the decisions than they hated.
<br />
<br />Most things went right. Some things didn't. Last year Romash's job 
<br />
situation kept him from attending, and Tony's job required him to 
<br />
arrive a little late. Some people graciously stepped up and covered 
<br />
the gaps. Due to a hand-off snafu, the NFFS awards never got ordered 
<br />
last year. Ray Harlan generously took care of them post-contest. 
<br />
Some people still aren't convinced that Nats Event Directors should 
<br />
be allowed to fly if they have a backup Event Director, despite all 
<br />
evidence and logic to the contrary. Etc.
<br />
<br />This year, NFFS pres Phil Sullivan decided that Van Dover should run 
<br />
USIC again. I don't know much of the reason why – we just got a 
<br />
single line email stating the fact. But I can't say that I really 
<br />
mind much, because I definitely enjoy flying more than managing.
<br />
<br />So, the issues we are seeing are mostly related to the re-hand-off 
<br />
back to Van Dover. I think we should simultaneously give him a 
<br />
little slack for the errors of omission, and give him a little 
<br />
constructive grief over the changes that don't make sense.
