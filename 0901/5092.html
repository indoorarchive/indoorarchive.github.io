Hi Fred,
<br />
     That is a good point  about getting the CD these comments.  I was hoping John K. would close that loop for us, but I am willing to do this if John doesn't want too.  I first thought we could have some discussion about this and hopefully some agreement.  I just don't want to force my thoughts and feelings about these issues without some feedback and support from others.     You typically fly towline, so I'm glad you replied.  It sounds like your fine with my proposal and clarification of the rules.    
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
 
<br />
Kurt

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Kurt,
<br />
 
<br />
I like your comments and am looking forward to towline and other events this year.
<br />
 
<br />
There is, however, one major problem with your comments, my comments, and everyone's USIC comments for the last 3 days. It is unlikely that the comments are reaching the CD.
<br />

<br /><br /><br />Hi,
<br />
Here are a few more comments, hopefully constructive to help 
<br />
USIC. First the schedule for gliders (which is what I really enjoy) 
<br />
changed. Last year it was from 7:30 to 2:30, this years schedule 
<br />
appears to be from 7:30 to 1:30. Now there are about 4 or 5 
<br />
individuals that are planning to attend this year who will come all 
<br />
the way from California and basically only plan to compete with 
<br />
gliders on Wednesday. That is a long way for 6 hours of flying. 
<br />
Also, to my knowledge last year the Towline glider event did not 
<br />
have any rules posted or listed that explained how the winner or 
<br />
placement of flyers was going to be determined. Again this year, I 
<br />
don't see anything written on this. I would like to suggest that for 
<br />
Towline Gliders; 9 flights are allowed and the best 2 of those 9 
<br />
determine the order of finish. The time starts when the model 
<br />
releases off the hook and ends when any part of the model touches the 
<br />
floor. Time is posted in seconds and rounded down. I think the 9 
<br />
flights are defined as ones in which an official timer has been found 
<br />
and has been notified by the flyer they are going to make an official 
<br />
flight. Once the model has been released and the tow has started 
<br />
(model moved forward 10 ft or more) the flight counts. If the model 
<br />
never releases off the hook (but the model has stopped flying) the 
<br />
flight counts as one of the 9 and a flight time of zero is given. 
<br />
Any comments/improvemen ts?
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
<br />Kurt
