<br />
The event director this year is Abram Van Dover.  
<br />
<br />I spoke with him on the phone the other day (I don't believe he is on 
<br />
this list) about the helium and some other topics.
<br />
<br />He was pretty adamant about not dealing with the helium.  The 
<br />
concerns expressed were that the event was losing about $200 per year 
<br />
on helium costs, and that the event management folk were too busy to 
<br />
monitor people filling up to make sure they paid.
<br />
<br />I told him that helium pretty much broke even for the last three 
<br />
years that I was involved in running USIC (with the inflation 
<br />
adjusted fill fees), but that didn't sway him.
<br />
<br />He suggested that we buy a disposable helium tank from K-Mart or Wal-
<br />
Mart, but I don't think that is a great option.  The $30-$40 
<br />
Partytime disposable tank has 14.9cf of &quot;party gas&quot;.  14.9cf would 
<br />
barely fill one 36&quot; balloon, and &quot;party gas&quot; has a lower helium 
<br />
concentration and is therefore less buoyant.  I think it would be ok 
<br />
for retrieval balloons, but not for steering.
<br />
<br />In my opinion, other more realistic options are buying your own tank 
<br />
(although that won't work for anyone flying in), renting a real tank 
<br />
(there is a party supply store down the street from the dome), or 
<br />
ordering and dealing with the helium ourselves (I have the info for 
<br />
the place we rented from the last three years).
<br />
<br />On the SO topic, Abram was under the impression that the SO airplane 
<br />
event did not exist any more, and was also concerned about the cost 
<br />
of the trophies for that event.  I haven't been following SO much, 
<br />
but I'm pretty sure there still is an airplane event.  And I told him 
<br />
that I thought the competitors would be fine with paper 
<br />
certificates.  I think including and promoting one of the most 
<br />
effective Indoor FF recruiting tools in recent history is the least 
<br />
we could do. 
<br />
<br />As far as other events, I don't feel that low participation is a 
<br />
reason to nix them.  It doesn't cost anything extra to run a 
<br />
concurrent class (they use the same airspace and processing 
<br />
personnel), and the trophy cost can be minimized by having only a 
<br />
first place trophy or having paper certificates.  Reducing the number 
<br />
of events for the purpose of eliminating similar classes or creating 
<br />
an orderly hierarchical progression &#x2013; well, that's a different story.
<br />
<br />Not to sound unsympathetic, but all the classes I fly are in there, I 
<br />
plan to have good helium one way or the other, and I've had my share 
<br />
of battles recently &#x2013; so I'm probably going to leave these fights up 
<br />
to you guys.
<br />
<br />Although, if no better helium options arise I might be willing to 
<br />
manage a &quot;Helium Association&quot;.  It would work like this:
<br />
<br />-	Pre-pay for a number of fills and top-offs based on size and 
<br />
type of balloon.  Cost to be calculated as your share of the tank 
<br />
total.
<br />
-	There would be a sheet with member's names and check boxes 
<br />
for fills and top-offs
<br />
-	Anyone caught cheating the Association (bigger balloon, 
<br />
excessive fills, leaving the valve open) will be publically 
<br />
humiliated via loudspeaker
