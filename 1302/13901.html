John,
<br />
<br />When my dad last ran USIC the contest was &quot;divided&quot;. The AMA did not 
<br />
want to support so many events as the cost for trophies was too much so 
<br />
events were split into AMA/Nats events and NFFS events and two sets of 
<br />
trophies were supplied. The &quot;Nats&quot; trophies were the events the AMA paid 
<br />
the trophies for and the NFFS events were the rest of the events the AMA 
<br />
did not want to sponsor trophy money for so the NFFS ( via Tony 
<br />
Italiano) funded the rest of the trophies, as well as additional junior 
<br />
trophies that I think my dad personally paid for (or at least was 
<br />
donation from his company) to make sure we had enough trophies.
<br />
<br />Granted that was some time ago when Steve Kaluf was involved and was 
<br />
being rather difficult to work with. Back then there was no help or any 
<br />
consideration from the AMA in regards to &quot;non AMA&quot; events, that is why 
<br />
you use to have to mail one entry form to the AMA and one to the NFFS. 
<br />
Fortunately now the AMA accepts both type of events but at the time they 
<br />
did not. I do not know the current relationship now in regards to the 
<br />
AMA/USIC/Nats but the separating of the events being flown back then was 
<br />
not along the lines of AMA and non AMA events, it was split more like 
<br />
most popular AMA events and &quot;the rest&quot;. So AROG which is an AMA event 
<br />
was not popular enough to be a Nats event so was dropped from the AMA 
<br />
Nats and was then flown as a NFFS unofficial event at the same contest 
<br />
with the trophy being NFFS supplied not AMA supplied. So I guess what 
<br />
event is on what form for the 2013 USIC really depends I think on the 
<br />
current relationship with NFFS and AMA. What does the AMA expect? Do 
<br />
they expect all AMA events to be listed on the AMA form? Or is it up to 
<br />
those running the USIC to determine what is an official AMA Nats event 
<br />
is and what events are flown &quot;unofficially&quot; (even if it is an AMA 
<br />
rulebook event)?
<br />
<br />Don S.
