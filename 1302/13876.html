<br />
The word should have been Minimum span.
<br />
<br />See the attache picture of the first Coconut contest at Pax river.
<br />
Six modelers entered the first COCONUT contest at Pax River; Don Srull 
<br />
with an  Alco Sport, Bud with his Spirit, Pat Daily with a Curtiss 
<br />
Robin, cannot remember this modeler with the Dornier, Dave Rees with a 
<br />
Waco, and Tom with a Lincoln AP.
<br />
<br /><br />THE COCONUT SPIRIT
<br />
Bud Carson
<br />
<br />The interest generated by my 36&quot; indoor scale Spirit of St. Louis at the 
<br />
November Pax River gala came as a pleasant surprise and I was quite 
<br />
pleased at all favorable comments it got. The model was designed for the 
<br />
sheer fun of it, and to this extent it was certainly successful, 
<br />
completing several dozen flawless flights to the delight of the crowd 
<br />
and the relief of the author, suffering nary a scratch or a blown motor. 
<br />
The idea came when I contemplated that magnificent flying site something 
<br />
was needed that would fill up the room but do it in a survivable way.
<br />
<br />Thus-the Spirit was reincarnated in indoor trappings. As such it won't 
<br />
stand up to the rigors of outdoor flying, but on the hand, has proved 
<br />
remarkably resilient to the inevitable wall and rafter bashes that so 
<br />
often spell disaster to typical outdoor models when flown between four 
<br />
walls. During the initial trimming flights and before the correct amount 
<br />
of rudder offset was established (which proved in the end to be far more 
<br />
than I would have thought necessary) the Spirit had its share of heart 
<br />
stopping encounters with the local terrain with nothing more than a 
<br />
split prop blade to show for it, proving once again that low inertia 
<br />
indoor model &quot;crashes&quot; tend to be rather leisurely affairs.
<br />
<br />I hope this example will encourage others to follow suit with their own 
<br />
versions, even though there are no official events for this class. In 
<br />
case there ever is, I have labeled this category &quot;coconut scale&quot; in 
<br />
keeping with the familiar peanut and walnut scale categories, the 
<br />
coconut being the biggest nut of all, yours truly excepted. To help 
<br />
things along, I have put down some thoughts, realizing that the 
<br />
formidable Maxecuters are superb modelers and need no instruction on 
<br />
basic technique.
<br />
<br />1. For a first attempt, stick with the tried and true. I suggest a 
<br />
high-wing, externally braced configuration. Feel free to tinker with 
<br />
landing gear length, tail surface areas, and dihedral (all of which is 
<br />
allowed by FAC rules, incidentally) and make a working sketch or drawing 
<br />
before plunging into the actual construction.
<br />
<br />2. Use Yoga, TM, or whatever suits to get yourself into an indoor mind 
<br />
set. Lightness not only spells endurance, it is the key to 
<br />
survivability; heavy models hit harder, and vice-versa. Select wood 
<br />
carefully for strength and lightness, and resist the urge (which can be 
<br />
quite overpowering at times) to add unnecessary structure. Don't get 
<br />
caught in the weight-growth tangle. When in doubt, scrimp, obeying the 
<br />
aeronautical engineer's credo: simplify, and add lightness. Be 
<br />
especially careful about tail weight, which can be a real killer. A 
<br />
needless gram in the tail may easily require three more in the nose, to 
<br />
balance it, wiping out as lot of the &quot;lightness'' that you have 
<br />
carefully &quot;added&quot; in-the rest of the structure.
<br />
<br />Remember that conventional models seem to have a lot of unproductive 
<br />
structure devoted to no other than to prevent warps, collapsed wing 
<br />
ribs, etc. caused by tissue tension. Since you won't be shrinking the 
<br />
tissue on flight surfaces, they can be made lighter than you are used 
<br />
to. The wings on the Spirit had only twelve 1/32&quot; ribs and the trailing 
<br />
edge was 1/16&quot; square.
<br />
<br />3. Take full advantage of any bracing that appears on the prototype. The 
<br />
wings on the Spirit were very tender when framed up and downright floppy 
<br />
when covered, which meant that they were about right. When the struts 
<br />
were added, the wings became stiff enough to take the flight loads, but 
<br />
still retained enough resilience to survive a cartwheel without damage 
<br />
(try that with your 15 lb. RC scale job !)
<br />
<br />4. Fashion bulky items such as wheels, dummy engines, nose blocks, etc. 
<br />
from foam. This not only saves weight but lowers their inertia so they 
<br />
remain attached during close encounters with immoveable objects. If the 
<br />
airplane is very light and the wheels are too, the whole landing gear 
<br />
assembly can be glued on to the lower longerons without benefit of 
<br />
weight-enhancing piano wire reinforcements. Coat wheels, etc. with 
<br />
Elmer's or Titebond to give them dent resistance, strength, and a good 
<br />
base for sanding and finishing.
<br />
<br />5. As for covering and finishing: all flight surfaces on the Spirit were 
<br />
single-covered with white paper that had been presprayed with silver 
<br />
Rustoleum. The celebrated N-C-211 registration number was applied to the 
<br />
paper prior to covering using a large stencil coated with spray adesive, 
<br />
and sprayed black. The fuselage was covered and shrunk conventionally, 
<br />
and later sprayed directly without benefit of clear dope. As a result, I 
<br />
don't think there is  more than a gram of paint on this model, which 
<br />
grossed out at just under 30 grams. Of course, tissue, magic markers, 
<br />
etc. can all be used, depending on the model. A light coat of clear 
<br />
acrylic on the raw paper will retard shrinkage and subsequent warping of 
<br />
the flying surfaces as humidity varies over time.
<br />
<br />6. After much agonizing, I finally decided to attach the wings on the 
<br />
Spirit permanently since there seemed to be no way of maintaining 
<br />
rigidity with a detachable wing. This has worked out well, and losing 
<br />
trim each time the wing is removed is of no concern.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yup...have a look at what I'm about to do:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1. Recognizable rubber powered scale model, with a max. 36-in

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's a problem: &quot;with a max. ...&quot;. That is not correct, especially

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since I have never seen a monoplane coconut with a wingspan under 36&quot;, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Aronstein's was very nearly twice that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the mere fact that we have for quite a while been sending out a set

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of rules for Coconut that have an error in the very thing that defines 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a Coconut as such makes me a bit concerned.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The corrected rules are to be sent out with the FAC stuff since we're
