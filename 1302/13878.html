Jim,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From what I recall on the Mooney rules the models were arranged in 
<br />
order of scale appearance when judged from 10 feet away. Say 6 models 
<br />
were entered they would sit next to each other and judging was done 10 
<br />
feet away and they were ranked in order by appearance. The best looking 
<br />
one was called #1, the next best looking was #2 the &quot;worst&quot; ranked 
<br />
number 6. The 10 feet distance allowed scale detail to not have to 
<br />
perfect as they would be if viewed from close up (same with tissue 
<br />
covering imperfections etc) . Then with flight score, you did the same 
<br />
thing, so the longest flight time was awarded rank 1, second longest 2, 
<br />
etc. So your total score was scale rank plus flight rank. If you had the 
<br />
3rd best looking model and the longest flight time (rank 1) then your 
<br />
score was 3+1= 4 If you had the best looking model (rank 1) and the 3rd 
<br />
highest flight score, your event score was 1+3= 4  which is a tie, so 
<br />
the winner would be the model with the higher scale ranking. So if you 
<br />
have the longest flight time and the ugliest model then you can easily 
<br />
loose to a better looking model that did not fly as long. If it is only 
<br />
a mass launch event at USIC then the Mooney rules do not apply unless 
<br />
the regular event is also added and someone is willing to judge them.
<br />
<br />I think some confusion may be created from the FAC Jumbo scale event. 
<br />
Typically a FAC Jumbo scale will always be a Coconut scale but a Coconut 
<br />
may not be an FAC Jumbo Scale due to materials and some of the rules 
<br />
differences. Coconut allows single covered flying surfaces and Esaki 
<br />
tissue but that is not allowed in FAC unless the full size had single 
<br />
surfaces and Esaki tissue is banned by FAC. I recall some guys building 
<br />
their Coconuts to be FAC legal as well so they could fly the same model 
<br />
at USIC and at any FAC contests since USIC was really the only place 
<br />
&quot;Coconut&quot; was flown.
<br />

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where do we stand on this?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Joshua, can you describe the inaccuracies of the recent rules? This is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a cut and paste of the 2011 published rules, which seems to go back as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; far as I can track it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. Recognizable rubber powered scale model, with a max. 36-in wingspan 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a monoplane, 30-in wingspan for multi wing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. Minimum weight 1-ounce (28.35 grams) without rubber.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. Built-up fuselage.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4. Scoring: Static points via Mooney rules from a 10-ft distance. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Flight from ROG. Best of 3 flights. Tiebreaker is best scale ranking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Was the 2012 one different? Are the above rules the ones we will be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; using in 2013?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
