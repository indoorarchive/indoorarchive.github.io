Don, I think you are confusing &quot;Esaki&quot; with &quot;Gampi&quot;. 
<br />
<br />Gampi is specifically prohibited in FAC events.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From what I recall on the Mooney rules the models were arranged in order of scale appearance when judged from 10 feet away. Say 6 models were entered they would sit next to each other and judging was done 10 feet away and they were ranked in order by appearance. The best looking one was called #1, the next best looking was #2 the &quot;worst&quot; ranked number 6. The 10 feet distance allowed scale detail to not have to perfect as they would be if viewed from close up (same with tissue covering imperfections etc) . Then with flight score, you did the same thing, so the longest flight time was awarded rank 1, second longest 2, etc. So your total score was scale rank plus flight rank. If you had the 3rd best looking model and the longest flight time (rank 1) then your score was 3+1= 4  If you had the best looking model (rank 1) and the 3rd highest flight score, your event score was 1+3= 4  which is a tie, so the winner would be the model with the higher scale ranking. So if you have the longest flight time and the ugliest model then you can easily loose to a better looking model that did not fly as long. If it is only a mass launch event at USIC then the Mooney rules do not apply unless the regular event is also added and someone is willing to judge them.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think some confusion may be created from the FAC Jumbo scale event. Typically a FAC Jumbo scale will always be a Coconut scale but a Coconut may not be an FAC Jumbo Scale due to materials and some of the rules differences. Coconut allows single covered flying surfaces and Esaki tissue but that is not allowed in FAC unless the full size had single surfaces and Esaki tissue is banned by FAC. I recall some guys building their Coconuts to be FAC legal as well so they could fly the same model at USIC and at any FAC contests since USIC was really the only place &quot;Coconut&quot; was flown.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Where do we stand on this?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Joshua, can you describe the inaccuracies of the recent rules? This is a cut and paste of the 2011 published rules, which seems to go back as far as I can track it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1. Recognizable rubber powered scale model, with a max. 36-in wingspan for a monoplane, 30-in wingspan for multi wing. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 2. Minimum weight 1-ounce (28.35 grams) without rubber. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 3. Built-up fuselage. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 4. Scoring: Static points via Mooney rules from a 10-ft distance. Flight from ROG. Best of 3 flights. Tiebreaker is best scale ranking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Was the 2012 one different? Are the above rules the ones we will be using in 2013?
