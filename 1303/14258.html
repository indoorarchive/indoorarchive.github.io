Thanks Joshua,
<br />
No doubt a lot of getting success is in the correct trimming.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I finally tossed it because it just plain wore out (meaning it was mostly glue), but I had a Hangar Rat which would do 3:30 in Cat I. You have to work hard to get this level of performance from them. I was flying on a loop of .075-.080, 36&quot; strand before tying. The model was somewhere around 4 g finished, and this was achieved by using 3 lb wood in the tail, 4 lb elsewhere. Even after gaining a full gram of weight it would still do 3:20 or so, which was enough to win consistently in local HR mass launches. Flight profile was to run in tight right hand circles by using plenty of right thrust and right rudder with left wing washout. You need the CG to be around 40% chord to do this. Launch was a fairly quick leap into the air with the model pitching to 30 deg nose up after reaching 5 ft altitude, where it would stay for about 30 seconds before slowly climbing away to about 20'. Around 2 minutes it would level out and slowly come back down in circles widening to about 25' diameter. This flight trim setup takes a while to achieve, but operates on loading the prop down as much as possible to limit climb while slowing the RPM's until later in the flight.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  This trim setup also works to a lesser degree on FAC Phantom Flashes, which will do 2:30 in Cat I if tweaked just right.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Another fun model is the old Comet nickel ROG, which takes 30 minutes to build and will do about 2 minutes in a Cat I site. Unfurtunately, you do need pretty thin rubber to make it go.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Hi all,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'm new here, and am keen to learn from the many experienced builders that kindly share their knowledge.  I have been building some indoor planes along the lines of penny planes, and smaller to fly in my living room, and I think I am getting better at building light.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Seems like a lot of it is selecting the most suitable wood for the job! ( and practice !! )
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I have recently built my second Hangar Rat, and have a question about the expected weight. Is it usually quoted as without the rubber?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The plane complete is 6.4 grams, and the rcommended rubber weighs an additional 2.5 grams.  I have not seen any mention of the expected weight of hangar rats, so I don't know what to expect.  I did put a bit of effort into selecting the best wood for this plane, but have not been able to find any weight anywhere? Anyone got some experience with Hangar Rats? I know they are pretty crude compared to the creations that you guys can come up with, but I am hoping that I can have a plane that will be somewhat competitive in a fly off at an indoor meet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Thanks for any assistance.
