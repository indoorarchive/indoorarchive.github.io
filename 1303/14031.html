Regardless of what the intent of your note was it comes off as very 
<br />
critical of the closest thing I have to a best friend in the world. I 
<br />
assure you that Kang is and has been very helpful and generous to a lot 
<br />
of people in this sport.
<br />
<br />What you don't seem to realize is that the ones of us who are serious 
<br />
about indoor FF competition are extremely focused on what we have to 
<br />
accomplish during the usually short period of time available at a contest.
<br />
<br />I've spent a tremendous number of hours trying to help new indoor 
<br />
flyers, but that side of me is probably not very apparent if you talk to 
<br />
me at a contest. I will answer questions within reason but I'm not there 
<br />
as a teacher - I'm there to try to put the hurt on my fellow 
<br />
competitors. It actually took several years of going to big contests 
<br />
before I had ANY conversations with the big guys, and even now those 
<br />
interactions are very infrequent until the flying is done.
<br />
<br />I would suggest that the time for learning is between contests. When 
<br />
you're at a contest it's time to apply what you've learned as best you can.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trip, to learn! on one occasion, not five minutes that I was basically

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; told to shut up, (I always had the courtesy to ask), Kang came up to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my friend and asked a question while he was winding, and he stopped to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was pretty upset that evening, but realized that a man who was

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; restricted from performing the activity that gives him &quot;Life&quot; can

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I want everyone to know that I'm not complaining, but I think that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many of use take ourselves too seriously, after all, it is a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after the trip. I even donated one of my rubber slitter (Harlan) to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; raise some money for the Kibbe Dome fund. After some thought, and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; encouragement of my wife, I made the decision to stick-it-out for now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For the new fliers, Mr. Lee included) just remember that you all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably asked a &quot;old&quot; experienced flier a question, and they never

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; said &quot;NO&quot;.
