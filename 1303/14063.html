<br /><br /><br /><br />Leo,
<br />
<br /><br />My criticism isn't based on anything prior to the last two years. I had been a loyal customer of Lew's since the early 2000s. In fact I bought a large quantity of Lew's wood from A2Z after the sale. Even the stuff that was what I wanted at the time was usable later. My issue is with the wood that A2Z is selling under the IMS brand name.  The wood that was not cut by Lew. These sheets are often cracked, vary as much as .007&quot; over a .013&quot; sheet and are completely unusable. 
<br />
<br /><br />If Tim would personally cut wood again, or at least oversee the wood cutting I would have no complaints. However, I think selling awful wood under the IMS brand name is detrimental to Tim's company and the hobby. 
<br />
<br /><br />Regards,
<br />
<br /><br />Nick Ray

<br /><br />Kang,
<br />
<br />I agree 100%. The True Weight wood I have is the best indoor wood I ever owned and I still have a fair amount as well. 100% of the wood in my 260mg EZB I just built is True Weight wood. If more was produces as it was once in the past I would buy a bunch it in a heartbeat.

<br />
<br />I have had great experience with A2Z. When True Weight Balsa was sold, I bought lots of it, and each sheet met or exceeded my expectations. Almost all of the wood used on my EZB's have come from A2Z. There have been rare mix up's in the orders. Each time, they offered to replace and reship the items.
<br />
<br />I understand that TWB is no longer being produced, and the remaining non-&quot;C&quot; grain sheets are not the &quot;unreal stiff&quot; quality I look for. If more TWB sheets were to be produced, I would buy them. I understand that A2Z has a lot of uncut wood of the highest quality. I now buy all of my wood from Nick Aikman -- the wood quality is very high and Nick spends a lot of time communicating with you making sure what you order is what you really want or need.
<br />
<br />-Kang
