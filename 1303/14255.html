Don,
<br />
<br />Just back from a morning of flying at Glastonbury! Beautiful air today.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I believe the high times for Glastonbury are still held by Drela's AMA Cat I record before AMA changed the ceiling height limit for cat I. I'll have to look up those times, they're shown in his article for his Upstart design. If I recall, they were something like 43 and 44seconds. Glastonbury is somewhere around 31 ft. There are many more obstacles in the gym since Drela's record that really limit HLG flying.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />The best I've done at Glastonbury (much closer to sea-level !) are in the 42 to 43 range but I will say with my aging arm I am more likely to be in the high 30's with an occasional 40 or 41.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I've been trying a Slow Poker (on my third one) but the higher aspect Upstart is easier for me to throw higher. My best times have been with some sort of variation of the Upstart. I've decided that next season I'll build a couple of Upstarts.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I'm gonna keep trying!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />John

<br />John, 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />What is the HLG site record at Glastonbury? We also fly at 36' (Colo spgs) but we are at 6080 feet MSL.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Only two guys have (barely) broken 40 here.Our times are down 10-15% from sea level. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />

<br />Yes!

<br />I've come so close to his times! I'm just not sure how many more years I have left in my arm. I would love to better his time. (he flew back when Glastonbury was still a Cat 1 site. rules have changed and now Glastonbury is a very low Cat 2 site.)

<br />Good to hear John! Isn't that where Dr. Drela used to fly?

<br />Bill, I'm still chucking low ceiling gliders here in Connecticut at Glastonbury High School. We have a couple of other folks also flying them.

<br />First place for Mr. Perez today!
<br />
<br />And actually I don't think there are any other low ceiling glider fliers in the Eastern USA besides me. Or if there are I can't find them!
<br />
<br />I guess it's just too hard.

<br />Sebastian did a good job at the state finals today with a two flight total of about 54 seconds. I don't know how he placed yet. I stayed for about an hour after he flew and didn't see any glider flights longer than a few seconds. There were several kit gliders that looked nice but the kids had no idea how to make them fly. I guess this isn't too surprising when you consider that there are no low ceiling indoor glider fliers in this area other than me.
