What kind of thrust does an indoor prop have?  Those things don't move  
<br />
enough to even pull a model out of your hand let alone fly by themselves.   
<br />
Maybe that's why those .000001 gram models of Kang fly so well?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
My biggest disappointment was when I let my first attempt at indoor go and  
<br />
it made one complete circle into the floor.  I was young, the model was  
<br />
covered in silkspan and used pirelli..1/4&quot;  I used an AJ something or  other 
<br />
prop system...hand wound of course!  That's all I could get.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Needless to say, I had no mentor and I was about 9.

<br /><br /><br />Awhile  back I was thinking about a similar problem with my beginner class 
<br />
models and  their flaring props. I wanted to measure prop flare at various 
<br />
torque  levels. My plan was to use an electric motor to drive the prop. The 
<br />
torque  could be measured and the prop photographed to give some info about 
<br />
what was  happening in the air. But, as John describes, I realized that a 
<br />
stalled prop  was not going to behave like a prop in the air. I had an email 
<br />
exchange with  Dean Pappas about what kind of motor to use. He came up with 
<br />
the idea of  mounting the whole rig on a cart that could be driven or pulled 
<br />
across the  floor at a controlled speed. This would be the ultimate poor 
<br />
man's, low RE  number wind tunnel. Of course the idea died at that point but 
<br />
maybe  someday......

I don't want to pour cold water on your idea  for using a test rig to get 
<br />
continuous data on how the rubber motor performs  throughout the flight 
<br />
because good, recorded data is usually the way of  making performance increases.  
<br />
However I believe that the sketch of  your proposed set up has a 
<br />
fundamental flaw that will make it  unsuitable.  The propeller in your test rig is 
<br />
static, by which I mean  that, although it is rotating, it is not moving 
<br />
forward and static thrust is  not really of much interest.  Unless the propeller 
<br />
is moving forwards,  as in normal flight, the angle of attack of the blades 
<br />
will be much higher  than the 'in-flight' angle of attack and any thrust and 
<br />
torque figures will  be meaningless.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
However there is a well known solution to this  problem which dates back to 
<br />
the pioneer days of powered flight - the  Whirling Arm.  The easiest way 
<br />
for me to describe this is with a few  crude assumed dimensions.  Assume a 
<br />
room is available for experiments  that is 12 feet square.  In the centre of 
<br />
the room erect a vertical  pivot.  Take a piece of wood say 1 inch square and 
<br />
10 feet long  and drill a hole in the middle.  Put the hole on the pivot and 
<br />
then the  piece of wood can be spun round, clearing the walls by about a 
<br />
foot.   In practice the beam would probably need to be built up to provide 
<br />
stiffness  with lightness and would need balancing about the pivot.  The pivot  
<br />
would need to be a low friction bearing.  It would then be possible to  
<br />
mount a motor stick, with motor and propeller on the end of the arm, wind  the 
<br />
rubber, release the propeller and watch the arm spin round.   Obviously if 
<br />
you timed and counted a number of circuits you could calculate  the 'flying 
<br />
speed' of the propeller.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I believe Bernard Hunt had a whirling arm at  one time and I know Dr Bob 
<br />
Bailey had one because he described it in  the 25th Nffs Sympo.  I recommend 
<br />
that you read his paper because it  will almost certainly help you to 
<br />
fabricate a better test rig.
