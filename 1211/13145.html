This discussion on &quot;static&quot; thrust goes on all the time on the E-flight forums.  Yes propeller efficiency is better as it moves through the air, but even when the rig is standing still the propeller is exerting a force on the air which in turn moves. I've been trying to use a wind tunnel study from University of Illinois (
<br />
Urbana-Champaign to understand what is going on.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.ae.illinois.edu/m-selig/props/propDB.html">http://www.ae.illinois.edu/m-selig/props/propDB.html</a>
<br />
<br />On this site there are plots of the coefficient of thrust as a function of J, a dimensionless airspeed.  As J decreases the thrust for a given rpm levels out.  The tests are made in a small wind tunnel.
<br />
<br />If the idea behind the tests Mike is proposing is to get at the power from the rubber, you could use anything, even a plastic P-30 prop, to provide the load. and as long as you kept track of rpm you'd have a consistent amount of air that the prop was moving.  
<br />
<br />It's true if you try to see what a big, slow turning prop will do when you're taking the energy out of the rubber over 60 minutes, you'll have a hard time seeing much of a force.  If you find a prop that lets down the motor in a minute or so you have a much stronger force.
<br />
<br />I fly a Dornier Falke no-cal that will reach a 40 foot ceiling in about 25 seconds with a Peck 6 inch prop out front while turning in a 50 foot circle.  It will fly out of my hand from a standing start, but won't go vertical.
<br />
<br />The efficiency of a prop on a static rig is undefined, mathematically, but the air still moves.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Awhile back I was thinking about a similar problem with my beginner 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; class models and their flaring props. I wanted to measure prop flare at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; various torque levels. My plan was to use an electric motor to drive the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prop. The torque could be measured and the prop photographed to give 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some info about what was happening in the air. But, as John describes, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realized that a stalled prop was not going to behave like a prop in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; air. I had an email exchange with Dean Pappas about what kind of motor 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to use. He came up with the idea of mounting the whole rig on a cart 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that could be driven or pulled across the floor at a controlled speed. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This would be the ultimate poor man's, low RE number wind tunnel. Of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course the idea died at that point but maybe someday......

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't want to pour cold water on your idea for using a test rig to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; get continuous data on how the rubber motor performs throughout the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; flight because good, recorded data is usually the way of making 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; performance increases. However I believe that the sketch of your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; proposed set up has a fundamental flaw that will make it unsuitable. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The propeller in your test rig is static, by which I mean that, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; although it is rotating, it is not moving forward and static thrust is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not really of much interest.  Unless the propeller is moving forwards, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as in normal flight, the angle of attack of the blades will be much 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; higher than the 'in-flight' angle of attack and any thrust and torque 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; figures will be meaningless.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; However there is a well known solution to this problem which dates 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; back to the pioneer days of powered flight - the Whirling Arm. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; easiest way for me to describe this is with a few crude assumed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; dimensions.  Assume a room is available for experiments that is 12 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; feet square.  In the centre of the room erect a vertical pivot.  Take 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a piece of wood say 1 inch square and 10 feet long and drill a hole in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the middle.  Put the hole on the pivot and then the piece of wood can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be spun round, clearing the walls by about a foot.  In practice the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; beam would probably need to be built up to provide stiffness with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; lightness and would need balancing about the pivot.  The pivot would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; need to be a low friction bearing.  It would then be possible to mount 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a motor stick, with motor and propeller on the end of the arm, wind 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the rubber, release the propeller and watch the arm spin round. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Obviously if you timed and counted a number of circuits you could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; calculate the 'flying speed' of the propeller.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I believe Bernard Hunt had a whirling arm at one time and I know Dr 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Bob Bailey had one because he described it in the 25th Nffs Sympo.  I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; recommend that you read his paper because it will almost certainly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; help you to fabricate a better test rig.
