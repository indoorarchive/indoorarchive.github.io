John,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Works for me, but if all of the tests were performed the same the  
<br />
comparison would be apples and apples.  Prop pitch being a variable.   If a series 
<br />
of tests were run with the same prop and only changing the rubber,  it would 
<br />
have meaning.  Using John or Brett's actual rubber / prop combo in  the 
<br />
first test would be revealing.  Again, actual flying is the  validation.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
When the rocket engines, etc were being tested they were strapped down  
<br />
too...etc, etc.  You just have to accommodate and do the parametric  
<br />
comparisons.  My intention wasn't to make this a difficult problem, but I  bet it 
<br />
would be close.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
And, when I used to run a design/test team, my standard answer was &quot;There  
<br />
is nothing you can do to ruin my day.&quot;  With that in mind, and improvement  
<br />
that someone is willing to suggest is more than helpful.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I used to get all of the new young engineers for some odd reason in my  
<br />
design group.  The first day I would sit them down and show them a  calculator 
<br />
and ask what it was.  The answers would range form a &quot;TI&quot;  or &quot;HP&quot; and the 
<br />
like...then I would say that it was more computing power than  what we sent 
<br />
to the moon.  We used slide rules and 3 significant  figures.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
My next comment was &quot;Engineering is not an exact science, but math  was.&quot;  
<br />
In engineering we would take the worst result found in test,  multiply it by 
<br />
.7, then multiply by 1.2 to get an allowable and then calculate  to get a 
<br />
&quot;positive&quot; in the result.  What are we doing analyzing to 12  decimal places? 
<br />
&nbsp;(note, 2 times 2 should equal 4, but what about large  values of 2?)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Being an engineer is like being a football coach trying to call plays (NFL  
<br />
type, not that other thing).  The rules are simple...run any palyyou want,  
<br />
but the best you can do on any given play is get half way to the goal  
<br />
line....
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
So, who makes the best engineer?  It's the one who knows when to kick  the 
<br />
field goal.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Just my tongue in cheek answer...
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
It's a start.  So, who is that person who thinks one could go all out  on 
<br />
this?  Makes for a GREAT Sympo article.

I don't want to pour cold water on your idea for  using a test rig to get 
<br />
continuous data on how the rubber motor performs  throughout the flight 
<br />
because good, recorded data is usually the way of making  performance increases.  
<br />
However I believe that the sketch of your  proposed set up has a 
<br />
fundamental flaw that will make it unsuitable.  The  propeller in your test rig is 
<br />
static, by which I mean that, although it is  rotating, it is not moving 
<br />
forward and static thrust is not really of much  interest.  Unless the propeller 
<br />
is moving forwards, as in normal flight,  the angle of attack of the blades 
<br />
will be much higher than the 'in-flight'  angle of attack and any thrust and 
<br />
torque figures will be  meaningless.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
However there is a well known solution to this  problem which dates back to 
<br />
the pioneer days of powered flight - the  Whirling Arm.  The easiest way 
<br />
for me to describe this is with a few  crude assumed dimensions.  Assume a 
<br />
room is available for experiments  that is 12 feet square.  In the centre of 
<br />
the room erect a vertical  pivot.  Take a piece of wood say 1 inch square and 
<br />
10 feet long and  drill a hole in the middle.  Put the hole on the pivot and 
<br />
then the piece  of wood can be spun round, clearing the walls by about a 
<br />
foot.  In  practice the beam would probably need to be built up to provide 
<br />
stiffness with  lightness and would need balancing about the pivot.  The pivot 
<br />
would need  to be a low friction bearing.  It would then be possible to 
<br />
mount a motor  stick, with motor and propeller on the end of the arm, wind the 
<br />
rubber,  release the propeller and watch the arm spin round.  Obviously if 
<br />
you  timed and counted a number of circuits you could calculate the 'flying 
<br />
speed'  of the propeller.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I believe Bernard Hunt had a whirling arm at one  time and I know Dr Bob 
<br />
Bailey had one because he described it in the 25th  Nffs Sympo.  I recommend 
<br />
that you read his paper because it will almost  certainly help you to 
<br />
fabricate a better test rig.
