One complete circle?  No wonder you're still flying.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />My first model was a 36&quot; span &quot;glider&quot; w/ 1/16&quot; (no typo:  one-sixteenth
<br />
inch) wings from a 3x36 sheet - no ribs, spars, or airfoil - sensibly
<br />
powered by a Jetex 150.  Early one Sunday morning, it arrowed through a
<br />
neighbor's bedroom window with perhaps one of the 3 pellets consumed.red
<br />
hot, smoke everywhere..they were in bed, having coffee and reading the
<br />
comics.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Took a lot of paper-route money to pay for that fiasco.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I was likewise about 9.  Turned my attention to girls for many years.

<br />
<br />What kind of thrust does an indoor prop have?  Those things don't move
<br />
enough to even pull a model out of your hand let alone fly by themselves.
<br />
Maybe that's why those .000001 gram models of Kang fly so well?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />My biggest disappointment was when I let my first attempt at indoor go and
<br />
it made one complete circle into the floor.  I was young, the model was
<br />
covered in silkspan and used pirelli..1/4&quot;  I used an AJ something or other
<br />
prop system...hand wound of course!  That's all I could get.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Needless to say, I had no mentor and I was about 9.

<br /><br /><br />Awhile back I was thinking about a similar problem with my beginner class
<br />
models and their flaring props. I wanted to measure prop flare at various
<br />
torque levels. My plan was to use an electric motor to drive the prop. The
<br />
torque could be measured and the prop photographed to give some info about
<br />
what was happening in the air. But, as John describes, I realized that a
<br />
stalled prop was not going to behave like a prop in the air. I had an email
<br />
exchange with Dean Pappas about what kind of motor to use. He came up with
<br />
the idea of mounting the whole rig on a cart that could be driven or pulled
<br />
across the floor at a controlled speed. This would be the ultimate poor
<br />
man's, low RE number wind tunnel. Of course the idea died at that point but
<br />
maybe someday......

<br />I don't want to pour cold water on your idea for using a test rig to get
<br />
continuous data on how the rubber motor performs throughout the flight
<br />
because good, recorded data is usually the way of making performance
<br />
increases.  However I believe that the sketch of your proposed set up has a
<br />
fundamental flaw that will make it unsuitable.  The propeller in your test
<br />
rig is static, by which I mean that, although it is rotating, it is not
<br />
moving forward and static thrust is not really of much interest.  Unless the
<br />
propeller is moving forwards, as in normal flight, the angle of attack of
<br />
the blades will be much higher than the 'in-flight' angle of attack and any
<br />
thrust and torque figures will be meaningless.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />However there is a well known solution to this problem which dates back to
<br />
the pioneer days of powered flight - the Whirling Arm.  The easiest way for
<br />
me to describe this is with a few crude assumed dimensions.  Assume a room
<br />
is available for experiments that is 12 feet square.  In the centre of the
<br />
room erect a vertical pivot.  Take a piece of wood say 1 inch square and 10
<br />
feet long and drill a hole in the middle.  Put the hole on the pivot and
<br />
then the piece of wood can be spun round, clearing the walls by about a
<br />
foot.  In practice the beam would probably need to be built up to provide
<br />
stiffness with lightness and would need balancing about the pivot.  The
<br />
pivot would need to be a low friction bearing.  It would then be possible to
<br />
mount a motor stick, with motor and propeller on the end of the arm, wind
<br />
the rubber, release the propeller and watch the arm spin round.  Obviously
<br />
if you timed and counted a number of circuits you could calculate the
<br />
'flying speed' of the propeller.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I believe Bernard Hunt had a whirling arm at one time and I know Dr Bob
<br />
Bailey had one because he described it in the 25th Nffs Sympo.  I recommend
<br />
that you read his paper because it will almost certainly help you to
<br />
fabricate a better test rig.
