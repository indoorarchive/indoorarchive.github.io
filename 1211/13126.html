Bill,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Everybody seems to write down the motor pedigree, winds, backoff turns and  
<br />
all that, so there is plenty of parametric data out there.  What I suggest  
<br />
is trying to get halfway to the goal line in the shop when testing motors.  
<br />
&nbsp;Flying in Lakehurst is a long term testing program for most.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Testing the rubber gets you &quot;energy&quot; in foot-lbs/lb...that always seemed  
<br />
kind of odd to me.  To me it implies if you took a pound of rubber you  could 
<br />
stretch it and chuck it up in the air that many feet.  Odd way of  
<br />
expressing it.  But it does compare all of the rubber batches.  It ort  of ignores 
<br />
the hysteresis and loss of energy ability of the rubber  batch.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Wouldn't it be cool if the profile for Brett's model could be extrapolated  
<br />
for his model and used parametrically for the next time he, or anyone, 
<br />
would be  flying there?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Think of the possibilities of prop testing in your own shop instead of  
<br />
having to wait until you could fly at a decent site.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
For the instrumentation..i.e. load cell selection and al that  
<br />
(Kirda)...find a commercial one that will measure in the parameters of torque,  tension 
<br />
and whatever you would expect to see.  I didn't say it would be  cheap, but 
<br />
the Gowen torque meter with a stopwatch is a great solution.   And for 
<br />
thrust, a spring with a ruler and a stopwatch can work too.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The secret is &quot;measured value&quot; versus time.  The torque profile I  would 
<br />
think would be of great value...especially with measured against the data  
<br />
that is written down.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*   Launch torque vs. climb rate to get to the cruise torque 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*   What's the cruise torque versus time of a given model / prop /  
<br />
rubber, etc. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*   all those things
<br />
This would make a great Sympo article...for someone of tech ability that  
<br />
has some time on their hands.  Plus folks willing to part with their data  
<br />
sheets(!).

<br /><br /><br />Hey  Rick
<br />
Weren't you the one asking awhile back whether it really mattered what  
<br />
size rubber motor you used on an indoor model? (I'm still a little ashamed of  
<br />
my answer)
<br />
<br />Seriously, I do a lot of testing but I call it motor testing  rather than 
<br />
rubber testing. I make my best guess as to what's going to be the  right 
<br />
motor for a particular site and then test all the motors I plan to use.  I 
<br />
haven't found it necessary or advisable to wind them hard for the testing.  My 
<br />
usual method is to do a wind to about 60% of max torque, back off turns to  an 
<br />
estimation of the launch torque I'll need, and then take torque readings  
<br />
for every 200 turns (10 winder turns for me) down to zero. The summation of  
<br />
the torques at each step gives me a &quot;score&quot; for a particular motor. A higher 
<br />
&nbsp;score is better in nearly any situation.
<br />
<br />A fly in the ointment is that  variation in the length and weight of 
<br />
possibly &quot;right&quot; motors will skew the  results toward heavier motors. I use a 
<br />
correction factor in the final &quot;score&quot;  that tries to balance the effects of a 
<br />
higher wing loading vs. higher  available energy.
<br />
<br />This may not be exactly what you're talking about but  it does tell me 
<br />
which motors are going to perform better in the air. That's  what's important in 
<br />
my view. Another really important aspect of this kind of  test is that I 
<br />
can avoid wasting contest time flying on a bad motor - or maybe  a better way 
<br />
to put it is a motor that's not as good as a &quot;good&quot;  motor.

<br /><br /><br />To all....imitation is the best  form of flattery.  Sotme time back I put 
<br />
out the attached little  dissertation.  It seems indoor model power systems 
<br />
are the key  component for a given model.  If one had sufficient test dta for 
<br />
a  great performer, say Brett's or John's models at peak performance,a nd I 
<br />
&nbsp;mean the rubber/prop system &quot;as flown.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
In my former life, the mantra was test like you fly.  My thinking  is you 
<br />
need the whole flight profile for a give rubber/prop  configuration.  The 
<br />
torque, prop dia, etc.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
If this does not come through, email me directly and I will send it  
<br />
directly to you.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
This begs for somebody willing to get out the stopwatch and the meters  and 
<br />
make up the test fixture.

Looking at your initial post, I see that you'll be  using 5 X extension on 
<br />
0.053 inch rubber for the start of your &quot;wind to  failure&quot; test.  Not sure 
<br />
how long a loop would last stretched that  far.  I haven't used that much 
<br />
stretch for Bostonians and such with  wider rubber.  Do you measure force to 
<br />
stretch the loop with a fish  scale or similar?  Perhaps adding weights to a 
<br />
suspended loop, like a  high school physics Hooke's Law experiment would give 
<br />
you that.
<br />
<br />A  starting point would perhaps use a 6 inch loop of 0.053 inch rubber  
<br />
stretched between 2 No. 10 wood screws 18 inches (3X) apart in a  board.  The 
<br />
larger wood screws might be smooth enough to keep the  strain from 
<br />
concentrating there.
<br />
<br />I've got a box of FAI tan in 3/32  inch (0.094&quot;) and should generate some 
<br />
preliminary data before we talk  &quot;exact&quot; though.
