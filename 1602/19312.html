Another model I can recommend for the beginner is Chuck Marcos &quot;Double Whammy Penny Plane.&quot;  There are two versions of the Whammy, and the penny plane version is no harder to build, but flies much better than the flat wing, plastic prop version.  
<br />
<br />The penny plane version is the model that I use to introduce my high school students to indoor free flight.  You need some 1/8, 1/16, and 1/32 balsa, plus some .013 guitar string and a bit of aluminum from a soda can top ( or a Harlan bearing) and finally something to cover it with.  It goes together very easily and flies well for a first effort.
<br />
<br />Heck, there was a guy on HPA who built the Banks Penny Plane as his first model.  Once he got it finished, I believe his initial flight reports were that it flew well also.
<br />
<br />The cool thing about indoor is that it can be as difficult or as hard as you make it.  If you just want to fly a model inside for 5 minutes or so (pretty easy) there are many classes that will let you do that.  If you want to build a sub 400 mg and fly for a national or world record (really difficult) there are classes that let you do that.  Winning competitions in anything, not just, but including indoor flying, is always difficult.  It's kind of like golf at that point.  Can I get around a course and have a good time?  Absolutely.  Can I beat Phil Mickelson or Jordan Speith?  Not a snowballs chance in you know where.    Can I fly in an indoor contest and have a lot of fun, learn a lot, and enjoy myself?  Yup.  Will I beat Kang, Kagan, Richmond, Gowen, Coslick, etc?  Very doubtful.  But the only way to get better is to try and learn from those who are better than you.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The price on those Sig props is for 6 pieces. The &quot;Mash Up&quot; model is actually a great flying model. Just got home from a flying session and three of us had these and they fly well in a gym, about 4 minutes flight time so far and are made from hobby shop grade wood. In fact some of the guys we fly with who are mainly outdoor FF guys showed some interest in building them. The 2 gram weight is just right and the 6&quot; prop is easy to build, you can even use a flat prop like A-6. I have a build thread on Hippocket forum, if you want to build one post over there and we will help you out.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I just looked at the Sig prop on their website. Saw sort of large blades, highly undercambered. Didn't understand the [6] in the description. Does that mean the price is for six? Or, is the price for one, and minimum order quantity is six? At less than a buck a piece, that's a fair price if it's six props. If it's only one, that seems very expensive.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'd like to suggest that some beginners, like me, who've never topped 30 seconds with a rubber model, need something &quot;indoorish&quot; that will fly longer than that, to pique our interest. Maybe the &quot;MASH-UP&quot; is suitable. If I got excited about that, then I'd consider getting into contests. I don't intend to start flying in contests until I've gotten a little bit of experience.
