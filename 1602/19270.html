The goal with any of these new events seems to be to offer events that attract new fliers to indoor duration style building and flying.  Josh absolutely nailed it when he stated that the expert fliers will be the most competitive in pretty much any and every event.  They are experts for a reason.  They have experience in building and flying and from that experience know the little nuances that can make or break a model's performance.  The people that have been doing this for a long time, and know what they are doing, are just plain difficult to beat.  It takes time and dedication to become competitive in indoor, plain and simple.
<br />
<br />By I digress.  If the original intent of new events is to attract beginners to indoor and have them competitive, perhaps we are approaching this from the wrong angle.  I don't think we need another class (but if we agree as the indoor community that we want one, just for kicks then that's fine too) but rather perhaps something like a system of tiers for competitors. When contestants register for a contest the can enter (for example) as a beginner, intermediate, or expert.  That way, they are competing against people with roughly the same skill.  Once certain benchmarks are reached, then you are bumped out of that tier into the higher level tier.  
<br />
<br />Now would that work or not to get more people into indoor?  I don't know, but it might be less intimidating for beginner fliers knowing that they are only competing against other beginners.
<br />
<br />My two cents, and that's probably all it's worth.  But it's out there.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Really, if we're going to officially sanction a &quot;utter beginner&quot; event, let's pick a good one along the lines of the Romanian &quot;F1 Max Indoor&quot; class (15 g min weight) where these kids can build truly nice flying airplanes from &quot;common hobby shop materials&quot;, though I hardly see hobby shops or their materials as common anymore.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the rebuttal to the above is anything along the lines of &quot;but this event makes it easier for beginners to be competitive&quot;, I have to ask how much competitive experience the person asking might have because since I started flying indoor 18 years ago, I've never, ever seen a beginner beat an expert at an indoor contest apart from the expert's model being hung up and/or destroyed, something that is of equal likelihood in all contest categories. If P-18 is adopted as an official event, it'll continue be won by the same experts. At least an F1 Max event would encourage innovation and challenge the participants with models which fly for an extended time. Another problem I see with P-18 is that it will be yet another event with a restricted motorstick length paired with a propeller demanding extremely long motors. That, by definition, is an expert level problem which guarantees difficulty for beginners. Even at my experience level I find it difficult to get an A-6 motor to unwind without doing nasty things. Do we need another &quot;beginner&quot; event with this same problem?
