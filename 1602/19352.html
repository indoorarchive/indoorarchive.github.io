I almost always recommend a limited penny plane to beginners.  For information on construction,  I refer them to Chuck Marcos' Double Whammy build guide and the Hobby Shopper EZB by Larry Coslick.  The models are different, but the construction techniques are the same.  I always tell me students that if you accurately cut to a line and glue two pieces of wood together, you can build a model airplane.  Granted, that is an oversimplification of the process, but there really isn't much more to it.  Come to think of it, with the Harlan Bearing and polyamide tubes, it really is just cutting and gluing.  The tricky part is developing the touch to cut and glue accurately the small sizes of wood used for the more advanced events.  
<br />
<br />If one is looking for more information on models and flying them, Hip Pocket Aeronautics' builders forum is a great resource, as is the Indoor News and Views website.  There you can find almost everything ever written about indoor building and flying from the 1960's to present day.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've been lurking on this beginner event thread, just watching to see where it goes. I appreciate that there are many different opinions which touch not only on events, philosophy, venues, and others, but what I would like to ask is what do people in the indoor community tell beginners when someone asks how to get started.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; R/C, and CL folks generally have well defined paths to offer, and to a certain extent, FF types can point a beginner in a direction once the person's main interest (glider, rubber, power) is identified, but what would you say to someone who says &quot;I'd like to learn about indoor rubber powered model, where do I start?&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I leave out indoor glider and power because I believe, and I may be wrong about this, rubber seems to dominate indoor activity so I think most beginners will be looking at rubber power. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My limited experience with indoor has been with LPP, rubber sport models, and indoor scale but when I embarked on those paths I already had many years of modeling experience so I had had time to figure out what I wanted to try.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Assuming for the moment that the beginner is looking for a path into competition, is there a logical progression you would suggest?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it SRPM -&gt; A6 -&gt; PP -&gt; ??? -&gt; EZB -&gt; F1D?  Is there general consensus on this?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the person is of a certain age and affiliated with a scholastic group, do you say &quot;Go find an SO group and start there?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you urge them to get a copy of BFIMA (Ron William's book) and use it as a guide for how to go about it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know ideally an experienced modeler would take the beginner under his/her wing and mentor them through the first few stages of the process but if such a mentor is not available, is there any resource that the beginner can use?
