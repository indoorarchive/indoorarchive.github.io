One quick addition to what Kang said - when a new school approaches you 
<br />
about coaching - or if you approach them - make it known how important 
<br />
the use of the gym is. If they cooperate to make the gym available to 
<br />
the SO kids then the next step can be to approach them about running a 
<br />
contest at their gym. If that works out (just a one time commitment) 
<br />
then you could go ahead and approach them about regular use of the 
<br />
facility. Over the years TTOMA has had several flying sites that became 
<br />
available thru a process like this. All have gone by the wayside for one 
<br />
reason or another but we had multi-year runs at several of them.
<br />
<br />And one other point - you will almost ALWAYS be told that it is 
<br />
impossible to shut down the AC. It may be a pain for them to shut down 
<br />
the AC but it definitely is not impossible. All such units are REQUIRED 
<br />
to have electrical shut-offs  either physically on the machine or very 
<br />
close to it. All that is needed to get them shut down is a maintenance 
<br />
worker at the school who is knowledgeable about the system and who has 
<br />
permission to shut them off.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think there are many points to be made about Science Olympiad.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; First, it is a fact that only a small number of students who fly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wright Stuff will continue on to indoor. That's fine. Indoor Free 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Flight is one of many possible things that students pursue during 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their busy times as high school or middle school students. My own two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kids don't fly free flight. They have their own lives that interest them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Second: Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the number of students who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continued, especially those who went on to the junior F1D team. Today, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there's no better place to recruit junior fliers for the F1D team than 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the population of Science Olympiad students.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Third: Very very few students each year who participate in Wright 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stuff actually are coached by Indoor Free Flighters and are exposed to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the indoor community. When I started Wright Stuff in 2010, the San 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Diego middle school regional had about 70 teams. Not one of the teams 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was coached by an indoor free flighter. Surely, we can improve this. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Last year, at most 10% of the teams had acceptably flying models. 90% 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of models stalled wildly or dove to the ground. At the very least, we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fourth: Although a student does not continue free flight, it doesn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean that he or she may not one day return to it later in life. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; started Indoor when I was 42 years old. Other prominent fliers did not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; start until they were in their 60's. All of us had some exposure to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model aviation when we were young.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fifth: We can use Wright Stuff as the platform to recruit coaches, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teachers, and parents to free flight. Adults have more time for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hobbies than high school students.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sixth: By volunteering in Science Olympiad, you may meet school 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; officials who will give you permission to fly your models at the gym.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Seventh: If you volunteer and meet today's students, you may get to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know better this generation of kids, who in my opinion are much more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resourceful than my generation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
