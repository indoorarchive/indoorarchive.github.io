I simply do not understand why it has to be adopted as an AMA event? It 
<br />
was not an AMA event when flown at the Nats last year so did people have 
<br />
less fun? If left non AMA the rules can be adjusted easily as needed. 
<br />
Otherwise stuck on a 2 year rules cycle and AMA style rules 
<br />
interpretation. Plus it is provisional by request and provisional events 
<br />
may not be flown officially at the Nats per AMA general rules so by 
<br />
adopting as an AMA provisional event it has to be flown unofficially at 
<br />
the Nats.
<br />
<br />&quot;The rules specifically identified as supplemental or provisional do not 
<br />
qualify as “official” model aircraft regulations of the Academy of Model 
<br />
Aeronautics. They may not, therefore, be included as official events in 
<br />
AMA’s annual National ModelAeromodeling Championships. AMA national 
<br />
records shall not be kept for these events. But these rules have been 
<br />
examined by those AMA Contest Boards concerned and have been approved, 
<br />
particularly for safety, so that they may be included in all sanctioned 
<br />
AMA meets, other than the Nationals.&quot;
<br />
<br />Seems to me that since it is so similar to Limited Pennyplane, why not 
<br />
just fly LPP with 7.5 gram min weight and plastic prop as the beginner 
<br />
event? That way it does not have to be a new event. Similar to what some 
<br />
clubs do with indoor FAC nocal, some clubs fly FAC nocal with a minimum 
<br />
weight like 6.2 grams but that weight limit is not in the rules for 
<br />
nocal, it is a local rule. So why not have an introductory version of 
<br />
LPP that is heavier and limited to plastic props. It makes more sense to 
<br />
me to have people build planes that are a step to an actual indoor 
<br />
event. Plus an internet search of Pennyplane produces lots of search 
<br />
results and building guides which people will find useful.
<br />
<br />Having recently built a Double Whammy with a 5.5&quot; one piece prop 
<br />
assembly and weight of ~5.5 grams, I find the model to be nothing like 
<br />
an indoor model and I would still need to add weight to get to the 
<br />
7.5grams weight. The models bangs and clang around the ceiling zipping 
<br />
around. It is more of an introduction to rubber free flight than 
<br />
introduction to indoor models. I would suggest allowing larger plastic 
<br />
props to calm the plane down some. I recall back in the early Science 
<br />
Olympiad years when I use to sell a kit, SIG had a nice 7&quot; prop assembly 
<br />
that on a 8 gram SO model would fly around 2 minutes in a cat 1 gym on 
<br />
3/32 rubber. The model was close to LPP size, tissue covered, prop 
<br />
unmodified and flew more indoor like. Those small 5.5&quot; props in my 
<br />
opinion actually make things worse.
<br />
<br />The 7&quot; SIG prop:  <a href="http://www.sigmfg.com/IndexText/SIGSP003.html">http://www.sigmfg.com/IndexText/SIGSP003.html</a>
