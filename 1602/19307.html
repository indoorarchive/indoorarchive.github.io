I joined this group about a month ago with the intention of just listening and learning, but your discussion is about beginners, that's me. So how do you start? I googled everything I could find, read Hip Pocket posts and studied the few plans they have and had a hard time deciding what to build as my first indoor. I'm about 3/4 of the way though building The Fly. I though I could at least test fly it in my living room. I started with the wing. Once you get used to working with small and fragile sticks it becomes easier. Well I cheapen-out and covered it with plastic from a cleaners bag. I was horrified to weight it, unbelievable - plastic is heavy. So I ordered some UltraFilm and some pigtail thrust bearings from Ray Harlan. If you want to take advice from a beginner the ability to change props easily is great. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;As an avid FAC flyer I started with their recommended beginner class Embryo. Not only is it a good class to learn to build and fly, there are many great kits and plans. We have many &quot;Expert&quot; flyers who enter Embryo but that does not deter the beginners. I secretly wear a 3 day smile if I'm lucky enough to beat an expert.  At the Non-Nats contest last July we had 92 registrants, 52 planes and 46 pilots were entered in Embryo - by far the most popular event.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;So I think a beginners class is a good idea. However we need help. Suggested plans and parts would be great. I really enjoyed building my first indoor prop, so much that I built 2 more. It will be fun to find out which one works the best. If your skilled enough to build the plane, you're skilled enough to build the prop. Enjoy the build.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I already got my eyes on my next challenge. I'm gonna build Don's Featherette. There is lots of info for new builders and that prop looks just crazy.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;have fun
<br />
