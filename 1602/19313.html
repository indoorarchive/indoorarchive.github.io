Ron,
<br />
<br />This is a great question. A beginners indoor class to me is a difficult 
<br />
thing to define because what is the intended goal with the beginner and 
<br />
where are the beginners coming from as far as their modeling experience 
<br />
or their personal goal? Is the goal with the beginner to introduce them 
<br />
to model airplanes in general? a rubber powered plane? a rubber powered 
<br />
plane flown indoors? a rubber duration indoor model?  People will define 
<br />
that goal quite differently and I think that is where the clash of minds 
<br />
comes into play.  I personally would not start an indoor beginner with a 
<br />
model that flew nothing like an indoor model if possible but that 
<br />
depends on the beginner being presented.  I do not think there is a one 
<br />
plane fits all beginner event for all people. Now if you have a church 
<br />
group of kids and you have 3 hours to build and fly, the AMA cubs style 
<br />
models beginner event makes sense, in that case the beginners event is 
<br />
really an introductory to model planes and rubber planes event. I view a 
<br />
person asking about indoor to be a person who is already beyond that 
<br />
stage, and I think many others think the same way base don the replies. 
<br />
Of all the kids flying SO or TSA  only a very small percentage of them 
<br />
want to fly something beyond a SO/TSA model, for most it is just a 
<br />
homework assignment. But for those that do, the next step for them is 
<br />
not back to an AMA cub, but forward to something like a Pennyplane. So a 
<br />
beginner event to me is much different than a beginners event  for a 
<br />
person with a youth group looking for an activity for the kids to do. So 
<br />
I think it really depends on the group you are looking to cultivate into 
<br />
new modelers and then tailor the beginner model to their level and 
<br />
goals. There probably really needs to be a progression of events. In the 
<br />
case of those 27 kids flying the P18 at the Nats last year, now that has 
<br />
finished, what is the next step for them? Where do they go from a P18? 
<br />
What is the next model for those kids who are interested in moving on? I 
<br />
think maybe this is how the whole newcomer issue needs to be approached.
<br />
