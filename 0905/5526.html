<br />
As someone who is a perpetual USIC attendee and who recently graduated from
<br />
senior status I would like to say that the timing has little barring on USIC
<br />
participation. The only year that I ever missed a USIC since I started
<br />
flying was because that years USIC was a week later than it had been the
<br />
previous year, so my parents made vacation plans. As soon as most kids get
<br />
out of school, they and their parents normally want to do something
<br />
non-academic. Thus, the beach or Disney wins over model airplanes. The
<br />
people for whom USIC is important pull their kids out of school and take
<br />
their vacation days to be there. If we start trying to accommodate everyone,
<br />
are we also going to move the site every year to move close to the person
<br />
who whines the loudest about having to travel the previous year? Goodness
<br />
knows getting to Kibbie from the east coast is trek, but a faithful few
<br />
people do it. The main focus should be on getting people into indoor to the
<br />
extent that they are willing to burn vacation days and travel eat the travel
<br />
cost. In my opinion this can be accomplished through regular local flying.
<br />
The Magnificent Mountain Men have accomplished this. In my several years of
<br />
flying with the Thermal Thumbers of metro Atlanta the only time I have ever
<br />
seen indoor enthusiasm wane is when  we have not been able to fly on regular
<br />
basis. Furthermore, Mr. Lew Young's after school program in the San
<br />
Fransisco Bay area has turned out noted Jr's. Tim Chang and Anjaney
<br />
Kattapalli. Several years Anjaney flew out fly F1D at USIC only to fly home
<br />
and take his finals the following Monday. Lastly, I not everyone is on a 1st
<br />
of June to 1st of September schedule anymore. a large number have got to
<br />
year around schools, and an even larger number are an a mid May to first of
<br />
August schedule in urban areas. Thus there is no one catch all date. Hopefully
<br />
that settles that,
<br />
Nick,
<br />
P.S. When I was about 12 years old I got the bright idea to test fly my SO
<br />
model during the F1D session at USIC, As I drifted out more towards the
<br />
center John Kagan politely asked if he could steer my model back in towards
<br />
the basketball courts. After doing so he smile and told me to try to keep
<br />
the model to the edge of the dome. In my experience spectators are every bit
<br />
as trouble some as juniors and seniors and we wouldn't have many flyers if
<br />
we closed our contest to the public. So most people tend to handle stupidity
<br />
like Kagan did in the above example.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am active in both indoor and outdoor FF. My observation is that outdoor

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is doing much better than indoor because of a general difference in

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attitude. Outdoor FF clubs/contests are generally more INCLUSIVE. I.e.,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; “Here, kid, chuck this glider!” Contrast this to most indoor groups where
