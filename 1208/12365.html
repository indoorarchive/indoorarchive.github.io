I supposed is good that people are talking about F1D. However, I do wish
<br />
more attention was paid to how World Champs are run and flown. There are a
<br />
number of variables outside of the model and rubber than greatly impact an
<br />
individuals results.
<br />
<br />A defending world champion fly's with a major advantage they are their own
<br />
team. A national team is required to have all three of its members fly
<br />
within the round. In Belgrade this meant that at least one team member was
<br />
going to have to fly in the worse air. A team manager can either choose to
<br />
share the best air by rotating the flight order or by giving to the best
<br />
air to competitor they think will do the best. The later case is what the
<br />
US did. This means thats not all the members on a team have an equal
<br />
chance. The difference between Brett and John's high times could be
<br />
explained by the order that they flew in.
<br />
<br />Secondly, mid-airs play a large part in the out come of the contest. They
<br />
can hurt if your at the end of a great flight or they can help by allowing
<br />
you to restart a bad flight. There were probably over 50 mid-airs in
<br />
Belgrade. I remember Ivan Treger having three in one round. There is no
<br />
trim flying during the rounds of the world championships. This means that
<br />
if you do trim fly in the morning or evening you are trimming the model in
<br />
air that is unlike what you will be flying in during the rounds. Judging by
<br />
Treger's constancy I doubt that the mid-airs helped him, but I know for
<br />
other competitors mid-airs restarted bad fights.
<br />
<br />The third major variable is steering. For better or worse steering
<br />
typically speeds up the prop RPM. This means that the model climbs more
<br />
than what it was trimmed for and spins off more turns than what it was
<br />
trimmed to do. Depending on when one is forced to steer, the model may
<br />
climb into turbulent air around the disk at the top and then head for a
<br />
wall while hitting the ceiling, or it may dead stick 40 feet above the
<br />
floor because is average RPM was higher than expected.
<br />
<br />Schram's winning flight was a no steer flight. I know that all of the US
<br />
team members would have preferred to not steer because of we wanted our
<br />
models to fly the profile we had trimmed for, but it never seemed to really
<br />
work out. To keep from steering in Belgrade everything has to be perfect,
<br />
the model, the rubber the launch spot, the wind and clouds outside as well
<br />
as the temperature. I think that no steer flights are more of a perfect
<br />
storm than anything that can be predicted consistently.
<br />
<br />Maybe that will give some context to the discussion,
<br />
<br />Nick
