<br />
Ok, had this morning a chance to fly in a large, 12m (36ft) hall, and 
<br />
did some measurements of the model afterwards. I had shortened the 
<br />
fuselage by 100mm, so that my overall fuselage length is now 800mm. The 
<br />
nose is about 50mm. My current (first attempt for VP) prop is a bit 
<br />
heavy at 400mg, so the CG is forward, and thus based on previous 
<br />
attempts I tried to move the CG back with a 35mm spacer at the front of 
<br />
the rubber. My best flight with a 200mm loop of rubber, wound to 22gcm 
<br />
at start, and no back-off, was 13 minutes, with the prop pitch going too 
<br />
low and model prop-breaking from about 5 meters at the end of the 
<br />
flight. I should increase the minimum pitch for better results, as there 
<br />
was plenty of turns left after the flight...
<br />
<br />The model has CG at 80% and about 5 degrees of incidence (plus 3.5 for 
<br />
wing, minus 1.5 for tail). The prop pitch for start was  around 600 at 
<br />
high pitch (except at 120mm radius it was almost 800 - so it looks like 
<br />
my prop jig is no good) while low pitch was around 300 for most, but 
<br />
only 200 at tip, and 500 for the 120mm diameter. Prop pitch was high 
<br />
until 10g*cm pitch, and met the bottom stop at 4g*cm. The rubber would 
<br />
to 1200 turns drops below 10 g*cm at 1000 turns, and down to 4 g*cm at 
<br />
200 turns. So there should be a few turn left.
<br />
<br />The model at the current weights 1.7 grams. The first attempt for VP is 
<br />
a bit too heavy, as is the wing, that failed under first flights, and 
<br />
which I had to reinforce with boron _after_ covering. But I was quite 
<br />
hapy with the trim setup, the wing twisted for high warps for the 
<br />
initial launch, but quickly settled for reasonable twist, and  the 
<br />
resulting climb trim was quite OK. Hanging on the prop, with tailplane 
<br />
barely keeping the nose from pitching up, but in good conditions the 
<br />
climb was ok, no tailslides. So I guess I'm not satisfied enough of the 
<br />
setup and details, so that I can build a couple of new models, knowing 
<br />
what CG to aim for. And need to build better props.
<br />
<br />Any comments on rubber dimensions, torques, prop pitch etc.? Am I even 
<br />
in the ballpark?
<br />
<br />Thx,
<br />
<br /><br />-Tapio-
