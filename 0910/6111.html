We had our Finnish Championships last weekend in a 18m football hall. 4 
<br />
fliers from Finland, and two visitors from Lithuania. The results were:
<br />
<br />1. Jonas Deveikis (LIT, jun)
<br />
2. Leif Englund
<br />
3. Rimas Steponenas (LIT)
<br />
4. Tapio Linkosalo
<br />
5. Reijo Liljedahl
<br />
6. Juha Heikkinen
<br />
<br />I do not know of all the times yet. My best was 18´40&quot;, a big-lucky 
<br />
ceiling scraper, the rest of the flights did tail-slides and never got 
<br />
away to the altitude. Leif did 18´49&quot; on his last flight, passing me by 
<br />
some 1 1/2 minutes, as his second was way better (15+ against 13+). In 
<br />
the overall scores the top three were quite close to each other.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I have two questions related to the turbulence.
<br />
<br />First, this was the first time that this hall suffered from turbulence. 
<br />
Typically it has been very calm and stable. I have been wondering, what 
<br />
made the difference. It is unlikely that it is the outside temperature 
<br />
(even though we flew late in the night and early in the morning, the 
<br />
skies were clear, so convective radiation may have been quite high. But, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;on the other hand, we have flown in the call when a winter storm has 
<br />
been outside, and the conditions were perfect.
<br />
<br />So my guess is: as there were no users of the hall before us, the hall 
<br />
was rather cool inside, and bringing the people inside provided a 
<br />
temperature source on the floor, heating the air on floor level and 
<br />
causing updrafts. On all previous conditions the hall has been in use 
<br />
before, with air conditioning bringing in warm air. When the AC has been 
<br />
turned off for the contest, the overall air temperature has been 
<br />
reducing, and therefore providing more stable conditions? Does it make 
<br />
any sense? A couple of hours later we flew a contest with F1M, at that 
<br />
time the hall was packed with people, the other end full of RC, and 
<br />
despite the RC's buzzing in the air, the conditions were calm and 
<br />
smooth. Just as they ordinary are in that hall.
<br />
<br />Second, about trimming for such turbulent conditions. It seemed to be 
<br />
the major problem for me and many others, to climb to the roof. A couple 
<br />
of tailslides/harriers, and you lost most of you climbing potential. On 
<br />
the other hand, if you packed the motor with turns, and then did not 
<br />
encounter turbulence, you ended up hanging in the ceiling structures. I 
<br />
first reduced the decalage a bit (about 1.5mm = 0.5 degrees), this 
<br />
helped a bit, but not totally. I did not want to reduce decalege 
<br />
further, as the turbulence disturbed the model every now and then, and I 
<br />
was afraid that making the model dive all the flight would have ruined 
<br />
the performance. Instead I concluded that the problem if tailslips is 
<br />
mostly the prop stalling, so I tried to reduce the prop pitch. This also 
<br />
helped a little, but did not totally solve the problem. I was even 
<br />
considering switching to a fixed prop, but did not get that thing going 
<br />
right. So, what is the trick of flying in turbulence? How much does 
<br />
reducing decalage hurt performance? Is a special, stall-resistant prop 
<br />
needed for those conditions?
<br />
