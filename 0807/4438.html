I thought it would make sense for the Indoor Board to decide this INSTEAD of the R/C guys. I guess it's too late for common sense to be helpful.

<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no idea if the Indoor Board (Indoor FF Contest Board, right?) 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;would be able to affect things, but it is worth a shot.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that the FAI Executive Council has already voted to deny 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;adding a third Junior (citing, in part, a rule that they added to the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;team selection rules in January, but that has not been voted 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;into &quot;production&quot;, nor published yet!!). 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The next possibility is for the Executive Council (different from the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;FAI Executive Council) to overide them with a 2/3's vote during their 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;July 26th meeting. The Executive Council consists of the District 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;VPs, the president, etc.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Does your District VP say why he is deadset against it? Do you think 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;there is any chance of swaying his opinion.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Bob Brown, my District VP wrote me back asking why there weren't more 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Juniors involved in the program. Here's my reply (please excuse the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;nationalistic hyperbole):
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi Bob,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Why weren't more juniors involved in the team selection process?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Good question. The quick answer: it is relative.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Long answer:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the 2000 World championship, the USA Junior F1D team 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;consisted of sometimes 1 but much more often 0 members. In 1998 and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2000 Nick Leonard Jr. was the Junior team. The Junior Team Selection 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;finals involved Nick flying twice, and that was it. There were no 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;USA F1D Junior teams before that.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came Science Olympiad, and a wealth of new Indoor FF fliers just 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;waiting to be lured into AMA Indoor FF and the FAI team selection 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;program. Starting with the 2001 Team Selection, for the first time 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;ever, there were more Juniors than team spots. The Junior Team 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection Finals became more than just a formality.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2002, 2004, and 2006, the US fielded full Junior teams - and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;dominated the World Championships. The US won the Individual World 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Championship, the Team World Championship, and the individual silver 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;medal every time.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And these weren't &quot;daddy-built&quot; models, with reluctant kids being 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;hand-held by the &quot;real&quot; fliers. These kids were the real deal. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's the proof:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Doug Schaefer: first every back-to-back Junior World Champion - 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2004, 2006. Current adult F1D team member. Finished 4th at the 2006 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;adult World Championships. Holds the adult Cat IV National F1D 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;record.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Brett Sanborn: 2004 Silver medalist. 2006 adult F1D team member. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Finished 7th at the 2006 adult World Championships. Current adult 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;F1D National Champion.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Justin Young: 2006 Junior World Champion. 2008 Junior team member.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Ethan Aaron: 2006 Silver medalist. Current Cat II National 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministick record holder.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Tim Chang: 2006 finalist. 2008 Junior Team member. Scored the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;longest single flight at the 2007 finals, Juniors *and* adults. Beat 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve Brown, 2-time adult World Champion, at a 2006 regional.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Nick Ray: 2006 Junior Team member. Current Cat I and IV National 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministick record holder.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This doesn't include all the other SO grads who have joined the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Indoor FF community, but never made or tried out for the F1D team.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So, on one hand, the number of Junior participants doesn't seem like 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a lot, prompting the question &quot;why weren't there more?&quot;. We only had 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;5 kids involved in the 2007 Junior team selection process, 5 in 2005, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;4 in 2003.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we consider number of participants since 2000 a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;wild success, a drastic turnaround, and a long term boost to the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Indoor FF community. 5 is a whole lot more than 1 or 0. And the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;success that the 5 have had, at the World Championships and beyond, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;has been stellar.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Also keep in mind that we have to find new kids every 2 years, unlike 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the adult team selection. F1D is a challenging activity requiring 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;extensive determination, discipline, and patience. There aren't a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;lot of people cut out for it. Finding and ramping up 5 kids with the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;self-motivation and talent to fly F1D is a chore - but one that the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Indoor FF community has rallied around for the past 8 years.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time that 5 participants hasn't been enough. We 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;lost one due to a misunderstanding about the age cutoff. Another due 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to his parent's unease about the political situation in Serbia (site 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the WC). And the last due to a double lung collapse (!).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than give up, however, the Junior team manager located another 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;talented SO flier, convinced him of the satisfaction in representing 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;his country in international competition, and has spent considerable 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;time helping him get up to speed. Will Curtis have a chance at 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;winning the world championships? Not likely. But, can he make the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;difference between his team winning or not? Most definitely!
<br />
