<br />AMA: Bringing Modelers Together
<br />
<br />Sounds like a great mission statement, but sometimes bureaucracy and 
<br />
rules do get in the way of bringing modelers together.  That was the 
<br />
case at last years Free Flight Nationals when a barley publicized 
<br />
change to late entry cutoff prevented several people that travelled 
<br />
large distances to compete to be turned away from flying with cash in 
<br />
hand.  Up until 2007 one could enter a F/F event the morning of the 
<br />
event.  However the FAI guys began cutting off entry the day before 
<br />
to facilitate pole position scheduling for flying in rounds.  This 
<br />
was not a problem in non-FAI events, but was adopted as policy for 
<br />
all F/F events to be consistent in 2007.  
<br />
<br />The CD was not happy about it, the fellow modelers were not happy 
<br />
about it, and guys affected by it were in disbelief.  However the 
<br />
rules were rules, and since a precedent had been set, the rules had 
<br />
to be followed and enforced the rest of the way.  The fact that this 
<br />
particular situation did not involve rounds nor warrant such policies 
<br />
was of no matter. 
<br />
<br />I am a firm believer in the AMA.  I have been a member for as long as 
<br />
I can remember, and have a son who was a member by the time he was 
<br />
two weeks old.  I believe that the AMA WANTS to bring modelers 
<br />
together.  I also know that it is a large organization that needs to 
<br />
follow the rules and bylaws set forth.  Proof that the AMA wants to 
<br />
do the right thing?  The late entry cutoff for non-FAI events was 
<br />
changed to accommodate late arrivals again in 2008.  Good for the 
<br />
NATS management for finding a way to continue to bring modelers 
<br />
together as accommodatingly as possible. That brings me to the point 
<br />
of this letter, and a similar situation still in process that can be 
<br />
fixed before someone has to sit out.  
<br />
<br />As you know there is an issue with the unfortunate loss of three of 
<br />
the Junior Indoor Free Flight participants in the team selection 
<br />
process.  Unfortunately the current rules do not allow for a 
<br />
participant to be added at such a late date.  Obviously the rule is 
<br />
there for a reason, and a precedent has been set.  However, this is a 
<br />
very different situation.  F1D is a very challenging and specialized 
<br />
event in all accounts.  Finding motivated and qualified participants 
<br />
in the Junior program is not easy, especially when they graduate away 
<br />
every several years.  I could go on and on about the success of the 
<br />
Junior FID program here, but I am sure you are aware of it.
<br />
<br />Instead I would like to focus on my viewpoint of this, which I feel 
<br />
is very applicable.  In 1988 the very first Junior Free Flight World 
<br />
Championship was held in Poland.  As a young Free-Flight competitor I 
<br />
applied for the team.  Being the first Junior World Champs, no formal 
<br />
process was even in place for a Junior F/F team.  Based solely on 
<br />
application I was selected as and alternate rather than a fully 
<br />
funded member by the AMA.  News of this travelled to my family and 
<br />
friends, local AMA members, and my local EAA chapter.  A fundraising 
<br />
effort was established by my local EAA chapter, chapter 45 of 
<br />
Pittsburgh PA.  Enough funds were raised through donations to 
<br />
completely subsidize for my trip to compete as a member of the F1B 
<br />
team.  We still did not have a full team, but I became a member of 
<br />
that first team to represent the AMA at a World Championships for 
<br />
Juniors.
<br />
<br />I say without hesitation that this experience changed my life.  The 
<br />
experience of travelling outside of democracy for the first time is 
<br />
something I will never forget. I forged friendships with team members 
<br />
I cherish to this day.  I discovered the depth of model aviation on 
<br />
that trip, and how it bridges cultural gaps that are greater than I 
<br />
ever imagined.  I will never forget standing in a field at dusk 
<br />
having a disjointed but very clear discussion with the members of the 
<br />
Russian, German, and Korean teams about the differences in being a 
<br />
teenager in our own environments.  Some of my fondest memories a teen 
<br />
took place during that week.  
<br />
<br />I implore you to find a way to allow a third motivated junior to take 
<br />
place in this event.  I understand there are rules for the Open class 
<br />
team selection process, but I also understand what it is like to 
<br />
attend (and almost not attend) a World Championship event as a young 
<br />
adult.  As important as a team spot may be to an adult, it is 
<br />
character building and eye opening opportunity for a young flier.  
<br />
For the open fliers, there will be other chances to compete.  For the 
<br />
Junior fliers, a life changing opportunity may only come around 
<br />
once.  If at all possible please find a way to send one of our 
<br />
deserving young modelers tom compete with like-minded teens from all 
<br />
over the world for a truly life changing experience.  Don't let this 
<br />
opportunity go to waste, Bring Modelers Together.
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
Jim Buxton
