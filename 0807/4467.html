Jim,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;There is actually NO RULE right now that says a Jr even has to be 
<br />
part of the team selection proccess. There is a rule that will be 
<br />
voted on the 26th of this month that states that a member cannot be 
<br />
added to the team if they did not attend the team selection. Right 
<br />
now there is NO official rule keeping Curtis from being a member. As 
<br />
far as the FAI is concerned a team member can be added right up to 
<br />
the point of event start.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;That being said my motivation and argument and one that tries to 
<br />
have an outcome that would save face for everyone was to have Curtis 
<br />
come to Lakehurst and TRY for the team. My contention is that he only 
<br />
be given the chance to be on the team, not just be given the spot as 
<br />
I too believe that would be unfair to the other Jr team members and 
<br />
to Curtis. He would have to qualify with times that are indicative of 
<br />
a team spot had he competed from the outset, if he didnt get the 
<br />
times I would not have him on the team.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I had put in for a team selction sanction for the 26th after 
<br />
talking with Greg Hahn who carefully read the rules and noted as far 
<br />
as the AMA was concerned saw no reason to not grant the sanction. I 
<br />
then overnighted the sanction form to AMA after discussing it with 
<br />
Greg and Dave Matheson. When the sanction got to the FAI council it 
<br />
was not recognized and turned down by the council, the sanction now 
<br />
stands in limbo. Here was the chance to have an official team 
<br />
selction event thus covering the rule which is not even in effect.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is very unfortunate that the FAI council would not 
<br />
recognize the sanction to even give Curtis the chance to be on the 
<br />
team even though there is nothing in the rules anywhere RIGHT NOW 
<br />
that say they couldnt do it.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course after the 26th, ironically the very day Curtis will be in 
<br />
Hanger #1, I am sure they will vote the rule in place. I have spoken 
<br />
to Curtis and as a true competitor he is still coming to Lakehurst at 
<br />
expense to his familly to fly his models anyway. I will post his 
<br />
times here so everyone can see if he would have made if only given 
<br />
the chance.
