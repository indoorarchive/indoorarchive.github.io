<br />
<br />I have no idea if the Indoor Board (Indoor FF Contest Board, right?) 
<br />
would be able to affect things, but it is worth a shot.
<br />
<br />It appears that the FAI Executive Council has already voted to deny 
<br />
adding a third Junior (citing, in part, a rule that they added to the 
<br />
team selection rules in January, but that has not been voted 
<br />
into &quot;production&quot;, nor published yet!!).  
<br />
<br />The next possibility is for the Executive Council (different from the 
<br />
FAI Executive Council) to overide them with a 2/3's vote during their 
<br />
July 26th meeting.  The Executive Council consists of the District 
<br />
VPs, the president, etc.
<br />
<br />Does your District VP say why he is deadset against it?  Do you think 
<br />
there is any chance of swaying his opinion.
<br />
<br />Bob Brown, my District VP wrote me back asking why there weren't more 
<br />
Juniors involved in the program.  Here's my reply (please excuse the 
<br />
nationalistic hyperbole):
<br />
<br />Hi Bob,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why weren't more juniors involved in the team selection process?
</em><br />
<br />Good question.  The quick answer: it is relative.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Long answer:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Prior to the 2000 World championship, the USA Junior F1D team 
<br />
consisted of sometimes 1 but much more often 0 members.  In 1998 and 
<br />
2000 Nick Leonard Jr. was the Junior team.  The Junior Team Selection 
<br />
finals involved Nick flying twice, and that was it.  There were no 
<br />
USA F1D Junior teams before that.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Then came Science Olympiad, and a wealth of new Indoor FF fliers just 
<br />
waiting to be lured into AMA Indoor FF and the FAI team selection 
<br />
program.  Starting with the 2001 Team Selection, for the first time 
<br />
ever, there were more Juniors than team spots.  The Junior Team 
<br />
Selection Finals became more than just a formality.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
In 2002, 2004, and 2006, the US fielded full Junior teams - and 
<br />
dominated the World Championships.  The US won the Individual World 
<br />
Championship, the Team World Championship, and the individual silver 
<br />
medal every time.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
And these weren't &quot;daddy-built&quot; models, with reluctant kids being 
<br />
hand-held by the &quot;real&quot; fliers.  These kids were the real deal.  
<br />
Here's the proof:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
- Doug Schaefer: first every back-to-back Junior World Champion - 
<br />
2004, 2006.  Current adult F1D team member.  Finished 4th at the 2006 
<br />
adult World Championships.  Holds the adult Cat IV National F1D 
<br />
record.
<br />
- Brett Sanborn: 2004 Silver medalist.  2006 adult F1D team member.  
<br />
Finished 7th at the 2006 adult World Championships.  Current adult 
<br />
F1D National Champion.
<br />
- Justin Young: 2006 Junior World Champion.  2008 Junior team member.
<br />
- Ethan Aaron: 2006 Silver medalist.  Current Cat II National 
<br />
Ministick record holder.
<br />
- Tim Chang: 2006 finalist.  2008 Junior Team member.  Scored the 
<br />
longest single flight at the 2007 finals, Juniors *and* adults.  Beat 
<br />
Steve Brown, 2-time adult World Champion, at a 2006 regional.
<br />
- Nick Ray: 2006 Junior Team member.  Current Cat I and IV National 
<br />
Ministick record holder.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
This doesn't include all the other SO grads who have joined the 
<br />
Indoor FF community, but never made or tried out for the F1D team.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
So, on one hand, the number of Junior participants doesn't seem like 
<br />
a lot, prompting the question &quot;why weren't there more?&quot;.  We only had 
<br />
5 kids involved in the 2007 Junior team selection process, 5 in 2005, 
<br />
4 in 2003.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
On the other hand, we consider number of participants since 2000 a 
<br />
wild success, a drastic turnaround, and a long term boost to the 
<br />
Indoor FF community. 5 is a whole lot more than 1 or 0.  And the 
<br />
success that the 5 have had, at the World Championships and beyond, 
<br />
has been stellar.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Also keep in mind that we have to find new kids every 2 years, unlike 
<br />
the adult team selection.  F1D is a challenging activity requiring 
<br />
extensive determination, discipline, and patience.  There aren't a 
<br />
lot of people cut out for it.  Finding and ramping up 5 kids with the 
<br />
self-motivation and talent to fly F1D is a chore - but one that the 
<br />
Indoor FF community has rallied around for the past 8 years.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
This is the first time that 5 participants hasn't been enough.  We 
<br />
lost one due to a misunderstanding about the age cutoff.  Another due 
<br />
to his parent's unease about the political situation in Serbia (site 
<br />
of the WC).  And the last due to a double lung collapse (!).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Rather than give up, however, the Junior team manager located another 
<br />
talented SO flier, convinced him of the satisfaction in representing 
<br />
his country in international competition, and has spent considerable 
<br />
time helping him get up to speed.  Will Curtis have a chance at 
<br />
winning the world championships?  Not likely.  But, can he make the 
<br />
difference between his team winning or not?  Most definitely!
