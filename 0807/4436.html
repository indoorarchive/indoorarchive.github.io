<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I just got off the phone with Walt. I asked Walt if he thought the Indoor Board would be the most logical and qualified group to rule on this situation. We could get an emergency vote by email in a couple of days.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The District V VP, Tony Stallman, is deadset against adding a third member. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My opinion is that there's no point in shooting ourselves in the foot by going with 2 members when there is someone else who can go and give us a chance to win. What is the big deal here?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, let me know what you think and I'll relay to Walt and/or the AMA leaders.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: [Indoor_Construction] F1D Junior team situation - they need your help
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;There a situation we're trying to resolve, and a very tight 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;timeframe. Here's the scoop:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The USA F1D Junior team has won the top two individual places and the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;team championship for the last three F1D WC's, and it looked like 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;they were on track to do it again this year. But unfortunately, due 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to various reasons, they've lost three of the five team selection 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;participants, leaving only two kids on the team.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The two remaining team members happen to be *very* talented, and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;stand a great chance of placing 1st and 2nd again. However, as good 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;as they are, it will be nearly impossible to win the team 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;championship with only two members.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The Junior team manager has located an emergency replacement - 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;another talented Science Olympiad flier - and is working with him to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;get some F1D models ready. This Junior would only have to produce 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;mediocre times to greatly improve the Junior team's chances. It 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;would also be a great opportunity to bring another new participant 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;into our discipline.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;There are apparently no provisions in the team selection program that 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the Indoor FF community has put together for dealing with running out 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of team selection participants, but our rules and regulations 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;indicate that it is the Team Selection Committee's responsibility to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;resolve it.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The AMA has already budgeted funds for a third Junior, so there is no 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;issue regarding finances. With the Indoor FF community's and the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;AMA's expressed support for kids in our hobby, it would be a crime to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;leave a Junior F1D team spot unfilled when there is a flier available.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem seems to be that our leaders at the AMA headquarters are 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;reluctant to set a precedent for adding a Junior team member at this 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;late a date. However, this is not in conflict with any FAI 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;requirement - some other countries don't even have team selection 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;programs. It is also not in conflict with any existing US rules and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;regulations. Worst case, we can limit future ramifications by adding 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;language that states this option is only available when we lose team 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;members that participated in the team selection program.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I say, &quot;.seems to be.&quot; because while the AMA leaders were initially 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;guardedly receptive to the idea and said that they would look into 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;it, there has been very little communication since. They haven't 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;given an outright &quot;no&quot;, nor have they asked for more information or 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;dialogue. We are running out of time.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where you come in. You mission, if you choose to accept it, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is to write an email to Greg Hahn, Dave Mathewson, and your district 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;VP expressing your support for seating the third Junior. Please 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;phrase your message nicely. Below is a sample letter, along with the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;related email addresses.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;*************
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Mr. Mathewson, Mr. Holland, Mr. Hahn, and Mr. [District VP],
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it would be in the best interest of our Juniors, Indoor FF, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the AMA, and the USA to field a full USA Junior F1D team for the 2008 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;F1D World Championships.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Please choose to seat Curtis Wernette as an emergency replacement on 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the USA Junior F1D team.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Sincerely,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;[Your name]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;[Your AMA number]
