<br />
There a situation we're trying to resolve, and a very tight 
<br />
timeframe.  Here's the scoop:
<br />
<br />The USA F1D Junior team has won the top two individual places and the 
<br />
team championship for the last three F1D WC's, and it looked like 
<br />
they were on track to do it again this year.  But unfortunately, due 
<br />
to various reasons, they've lost three of the five team selection 
<br />
participants, leaving only two kids on the team.
<br />
<br />The two remaining team members happen to be *very* talented, and 
<br />
stand a great chance of placing 1st and 2nd again.  However, as good 
<br />
as they are, it will be nearly impossible to win the team 
<br />
championship with only two members.
<br />
<br />The Junior team manager has located an emergency replacement &#x2013; 
<br />
another talented Science Olympiad flier - and is working with him to 
<br />
get some F1D models ready.  This Junior would only have to produce 
<br />
mediocre times to greatly improve the Junior team's chances.  It 
<br />
would also be a great opportunity to bring another new participant 
<br />
into our discipline.
<br />
<br />There are apparently no provisions in the team selection program that 
<br />
the Indoor FF community has put together for dealing with running out 
<br />
of team selection participants, but our rules and regulations 
<br />
indicate that it is the Team Selection Committee's responsibility to 
<br />
resolve it.
<br />
<br />The AMA has already budgeted funds for a third Junior, so there is no 
<br />
issue regarding finances.  With the Indoor FF community's and the 
<br />
AMA's expressed support for kids in our hobby, it would be a crime to 
<br />
leave a Junior F1D team spot unfilled when there is a flier available.
<br />
<br />The problem seems to be that our leaders at the AMA headquarters are 
<br />
reluctant to set a precedent for adding a Junior team member at this 
<br />
late a date.  However, this is not in conflict with any FAI 
<br />
requirement &#x2013; some other countries don't even have team selection 
<br />
programs.  It is also not in conflict with any existing US rules and 
<br />
regulations.  Worst case, we can limit future ramifications by adding 
<br />
language that states this option is only available when we lose team 
<br />
members that participated in the team selection program.
<br />
<br />I say, &quot;&#x2026;seems to be&#x2026;&quot; because while the AMA leaders were initially 
<br />
guardedly receptive to the idea and said that they would look into 
<br />
it, there has been very little communication since.  They haven't 
<br />
given an outright &quot;no&quot;, nor have they asked for more information or 
<br />
dialogue.  We are running out of time.
<br />
<br />This is where you come in.  You mission, if you choose to accept it, 
<br />
is to write an email to Greg Hahn, Dave Mathewson, and your district 
<br />
VP expressing your support for seating the third Junior.  Please 
<br />
phrase your message nicely.  Below is a sample letter, along with the 
<br />
related email addresses.
<br />
<br /><br />*************
<br />
Dear Mr. Mathewson, Mr. Holland, Mr. Hahn, and Mr. [District VP],
<br />
<br />I believe it would be in the best interest of our Juniors, Indoor FF, 
<br />
the AMA, and the USA to field a full USA Junior F1D team for the 2008 
<br />
F1D World Championships.
<br />
<br />Please choose to seat Curtis Wernette as an emergency replacement on 
<br />
the USA Junior F1D team.
<br />
<br />Sincerely,
<br />
[Your name]
<br />
[Your AMA number]
