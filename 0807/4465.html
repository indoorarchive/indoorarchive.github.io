In the actual massage I sent to Tony Stillman the quote from Jim Buxton was separated and italicized. That got lost when I copied the message to the Yahoo list.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: [Indoor_Construction] Message sent to Tony Stillman - my district VP
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Tony I've been observing the discussion about seating a third Junior
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;team member for some time now. I had high hopes that the FAI Executive
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee would do the right thing and allow a third team member to be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;selected. When they refused, an emergency qualifying event was put
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;together to occur at Lakehurst in a week or so. This should have settled
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the issue, but apparently the FAIEC didn't agree. My first reaction to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;this situation was that the proper body to rule on it would have been
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the Indoor Contest Board. Before I could make that suggestion, the FAIEC
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;had already ruled. I can tell you that everyone I have heard from -
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;which includes many of the world's best indoor flyers - is totally
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;shocked by this ruling. I could spend all day trying to voice all my
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;concerns about this, but instead let me quote from an email sent by Jim
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Buxton to Bob Brown, his district VP: As you know there is an issue
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;with the unfortunate loss of three of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the Junior Indoor Free Flight participants in the team selection
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;process. Unfortunately the current rules do not allow for a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;participant to be added at such a late date. Obviously the rule is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;there for a reason, and a precedent has been set. However, this is a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;very different situation. F1D is a very challenging and specialized
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;event in all accounts. Finding motivated and qualified participants
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the Junior program is not easy, especially when they graduate away
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;every several years. I could go on and on about the success of the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Junior FID program here, but I am sure you are aware of it.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead I would like to focus on my viewpoint of this, which I feel
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is very applicable. In 1988 the very first Junior Free Flight World
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Championship was held in Poland. As a young Free-Flight competitor I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;applied for the team. Being the first Junior World Champs, no formal
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;process was even in place for a Junior F/F team. Based solely on
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;application I was selected as and alternate rather than a fully
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;funded member by the AMA. News of this travelled to my family and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;friends, local AMA members, and my local EAA chapter. A fundraising
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;effort was established by my local EAA chapter, chapter 45 of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pittsburgh PA. Enough funds were raised through donations to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;completely subsidize for my trip to compete as a member of the F1B
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;team. We still did not have a full team, but I became a member of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that first team to represent the AMA at a World Championships for
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Juniors.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I say without hesitation that this experience changed my life. The
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;experience of travelling outside of democracy for the first time is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;something I will never forget. I forged friendships with team members
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I cherish to this day. I discovered the depth of model aviation on
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that trip, and how it bridges cultural gaps that are greater than I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;ever imagined. I will never forget standing in a field at dusk
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;having a disjointed but very clear discussion with the members of the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Russian, German, and Korean teams about the differences in being a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;teenager in our own environments. Some of my fondest memories a teen
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;took place during that week.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I implore you to find a way to allow a third motivated junior to take
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;place in this event. I understand there are rules for the Open class
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;team selection process, but I also understand what it is like to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;attend (and almost not attend) a World Championship event as a young
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;adult. As important as a team spot may be to an adult, it is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;character building and eye opening opportunity for a young flier.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the open fliers, there will be other chances to compete. For the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Junior fliers, a life changing opportunity may only come around
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;once. If at all possible please find a way to send one of our
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;deserving young modelers tom compete with like-minded teens from all
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;over the world for a truly life changing experience. Don't let this
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;opportunity go to waste, Bring Modelers Together.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Respectfully,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim Buxton
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;AMA 75154
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Columbus Ohio Tony, I respectfully ask that you vote to overturn this
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;decision. Our team deserves the chance to win and the third team member
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- if he is allowed to go - will benefit in ways that far outweigh the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;concerns being expressed. Bill Gowen AMA 6157 CD Indoor Contest Board
