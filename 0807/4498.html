35-40 degrees? that thought was definetley in the back of my mind when i was setting the prop blades.I experienced some dry winds recently and when i took the A6 out of it's foam box the tissue had warped the structure. A freind told me to shrink it on a frame with water until it starts to over shrink and then iron it so that all the moisture is removed. this is what i am doing and i hope to be flying her soon..
<br />

<br />I seem to always use larger motors than most people. My 9:30 at USIC 2007 was on 1 gram of 5/99 x 18&quot; (.050&quot;). I've never done well with 45 degree prop blades. Mine typically are set in the 34 to 38 degree range.

<br />
<br /><br />  I am not familiar with that particular plan. However, based on my 
<br />
  experience, I think you are on the right track with the information below. Two 
<br />
  comments. I doubt that you need to increase the rudder area, but doing so won't hurt 
<br />
  either. I think the 0.030&quot; rubber will prove to be too small. If you are 
<br />
  flying in a typical gym, I would use a 13&quot;-15&quot; loop of 0.034&quot; rubber. The thicker 
<br />
  rubber will improve the cruise portion of the flight. If you are not happy 
<br />
  with the results, look around for a proven design &amp; build it exactly as shown. 
<br />
  Don't try to improve it until you have a good base line of experience with 
<br />
  the proven design.

<br />  Hi there all, I am looking for some expert guidance on a beginers level 
<br />
  A6. I am not new to free flight, but am i new to A6. I have built lots 
<br />
  of peanuts and have actually won an Indoor peanut scale contest. I made 
<br />
  an A6-5a by bruce mcrory. I did enlarge the rudder,The plan indicated 
<br />
  that the rudder had been reduced in size as a test to see how it went. 
<br />
  I did not need that agrivation to start out with so i increased the 
<br />
  rudder by about 15%. The models all up weight is 1.2 grams. It is 
<br />
  covered in pre shrunk condensor paper and i am looking for some expert 
<br />
  advice on trimming. My prop blades are set at 45 degrees to one another 
<br />
  and i have used a twisted wire pigtail prop hangar. 
<br />
<br />  I plan on using .030 rubber to start with as per the plan and we will 
<br />
  see how i go from there. If there is anyone out there with some tips 
<br />
  that would be greatly appreciated.
<br />
