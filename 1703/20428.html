I will restate my initial comment:
<br />
<br />I have nothing against this new event, but I do not think it will result in the stated goal:
<br />
&quot;the idea is a model that's a stepping stone to more advanced classes&quot;
<br />
<br />I never suggested any rules changes. I simply tried to point out some of the voids in the rules which I think will be exploited (as they should be) by the more advanced &amp; competitive fliers, should they choose to fly this event. This is why I do not think it will result in the stated goal. 
<br />
<br />For the record, I could be wrong! I would be interested in hearing if others on this list think this event will lead to the stated goal? Who on the list plan to build &amp; fly one?

<br />
<br />Gary,
<br />
<br /><br />I don't speak for Wally, but I want to address your concerns as best I can since I'm coordinating the Kibbie Contest.
<br />
<br /><br />&quot;no limit on props could result in unusual prop diameters. I.E. very large props.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />Prop diameter is typically dictated by model size and weight.  Nobody will be flying one of these with a 25&quot; prop because it doesn't offer any advantage.  EZB doesn't have a prop size limitation, and most people use props between 12&quot; and 14&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />&quot;no limit on materials of construction materials = lots of carbon fiber parts, boron, etc.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />Carbon fiber and boron are common materials on advanced classes of models.  This is designed to be an intermediate class, so banning materials that will likely be used on more advanced models defeats the purpose.  If someone is trying to progress from pennyplane or F1L to a class like F1D, they will eventually need to become familiar with these materials.  That said, it would be entirely possible to build a competitive X-16 model without boron or carbon fiber.
<br />
<br /><br />&quot;no limit on rubber weight &amp;/or front bearing to rear hook dimensions, no limit on tail boom length. I see some very long airframes in this class.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Restricting hook to hook distances actually makes models much more difficult to fly in my opinion.  This restriction in LPP causes major issues as people must find ways to limit the knot bunching that inevitably happens when you use a 20&quot; loop of rubber on a 10&quot; fuselage.
<br />
<br /><br />&quot;Paper covering? Really? What a joke!&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />A more concise way to write that rule would be to simply say microfilm is not allowed.  Obviously nobody is going to cover one of these with condenser paper, but I do believe it would be possible to reach the minimum weight with CP if someone was truly determined.
<br />
<br /><br />&quot;Are flaring props fixed pitch or are flaring props gadgets? Who gets to decide what a gadget is?&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />For a better definition of gadgets, I'll simply copy/paste one of the rules from Easy B.  This would include devices like VP, VD, and torque burners.  Flaring props are not a gadget.
<br />
<br /><br />It is prohibited to use any scheme, device, or mechanism which affects the rate ofenergy release from the rubber motor, except for propeller blade flare or deformation.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Regards,
<br />
Jake

Because there are only a few restrictions, I can foresee this event quickly progressing to another very advanced event, if it catches on at all. Just a few examples of what could evolve: 
<br />
no limit on props could result in unusual prop diameters. I.E. very large props. 
<br />
no limit on materials of construction materials = lots of carbon fiber parts, boron, etc.
<br />
no limit on rubber weight &amp;/or front bearing to rear hook dimensions, no limit on tail boom length. I see some very long airframes in this class.

<br />As some people may know, Wally Miller is the original creator of the Easy B event.  He's back at it again with a proposal for an event that he's calling X-16.  You can read more details at the link below, but the idea is a model that's a stepping stone to more advanced classes like intermediate stick and F1D.  Wally has kindly donated trophies for 1snott and 2nd place at this years Kibbie Dome Annual contest.  While this is not an AMA event, it will be flown as an official event.  I've included the rules below, and an article from Wally that explains more about his goals as well as a plan for his prototype model.
<br />
<br />X-16 Rules
<br />
Monoplane
<br />
Maximum wingspan shall not exceed 16 inches projected
<br />
Maximum wing chord shall not exceed 4 inches
<br />
Stabilizer area shall not exceed 50% of wing area
<br />
Complete model without motor shall weigh at least 0.0280oz
<br />
Propeller shall be fixed pitch.  Hubs that allow manual blade and pitch change are acceptable
<br />
Covering can be plastic film or paper.  Microfilm is not allowed
<br />
No gadgets of any kind are permitted
