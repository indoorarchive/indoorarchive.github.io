<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now I wonder what is the best knot for the tiny 0.4g rubber? And when 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do you do the knot in regards to the lubrication?
</em><br />
I use two kinds of knots for all my rubber, from F1D indoor to F1B. Both 
<br />
were tought to me by Bror Eimar. Both need to be tied to lubed rubber 
<br />
strip, but the lube should be of low viscosity for F1B motor break-in, 
<br />
otherwise the knots may slip and the strip cut through itself. For 
<br />
indoor, I do not break-in individual motors, but if I do some break-in, 
<br />
stretch a larger amount of rubber before cutting to width, so here knot 
<br />
tied to strip lubed with thicker silicone will hold the loads of winding.
<br />
<br />The first is called &quot;norsk strikknut&quot;. It starts with a square knot, 
<br />
then extra knots are tied to each end, and all three knots are carefully 
<br />
pulled together. See attached picture. This knot has the advantage, that 
<br />
the &quot;ends&quot; of the rubber strip leave the knot in opposite directions, so 
<br />
I feel that it stands better the wear and loads of strip stretching. For 
<br />
indoor use, on the other hand, it is harder to control the position of 
<br />
the knot, so making motors to precise weight is harder. Yet I still use 
<br />
this knot for the motors that I expect to see hardest strain.
<br />
<br />Another and easier knot that I use is made by putting the ends of the 
<br />
motor over each other (pointing the same way), then tying a square knot 
<br />
with the ends. Next the free ends are turned one turn around the &quot;stem&quot; 
<br />
of the knot (in the same &quot;direction&quot; as the square knot goes), after 
<br />
which the ends are out through the loop of the square knot, and the knot 
<br />
is tightened. In practice, I make the square knot, put the tip of the 
<br />
forefinger through the loop and twist my wrist to turn the loop one  
<br />
round while holding the base of the knot with other hand, and push the 
<br />
free ends through the loop. This loop has both strips exiting the same 
<br />
direction, so when the strip is pulled they kind of stretch against the 
<br />
body of the knot, which is not good. But it is easy to make so if I need 
<br />
to tie a broken strand on F1B practice motor I use that. Also it is easy 
<br />
to control the length of the free ends, so when making indoor motors I 
<br />
have better control of the motor weight. Talking of which, I usually 
<br />
make my motors by cutting them to a controlled amount of extra weight, 
<br />
then have a short strip or two as a reference of that extra weight. Thus 
<br />
I know how long free ends I aim to leave to the motor when tying the 
<br />
knot, and once the knot is tight I trim that much of the ends (hopefully 
<br />
next to the knot) and end up with a motor exactly to the weight limit, 
<br />
and minimal ends protruding out of the knot. This latter knot is quite 
<br />
easy and light, so especially for F1M, if I end up with an overweight 
<br />
motor, I tie another similar knot next to the first one, use the first 
<br />
knot to pull the second tight, and finally cut off the first knot. 
<br />
Typically I'f end with a motor that is not too much underweight.

</em><br />
<br />Dow 33 is extremely thick grease. F1B guys used to &quot;thin&quot; it with thin 
<br />
silicone fluid to get proper grease for their motors. The 10,000 to 
<br />
15,000 cTs fluid is much thinner, something like (sugar syrup). In my 
<br />
experience it does not make the rubber stick to itself.
