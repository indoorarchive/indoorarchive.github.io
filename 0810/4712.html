I've never really liked working with the stuff, since one of my
<br />
concerns has always been getting it in my eyes...  Not from flying
<br />
pieces, but since I wear contacts, and tend to do most of my building
<br />
late in the evening and then retire for the night, I have to take out
<br />
my contacts...  My concern has been getting a small shard on my
<br />
finger, and then getting it in my eye when taking the contact out... 
<br />
I -usually- wear glasses now when I am working with boron, to
<br />
eliminate that problem...  
<br />
<br />I've only stuck myself once with it, and it pretty easy...  it didn't
<br />
break off and pulled right out, but went into a finger on the side and
<br />
came right out the other side, going through about 1/4&quot; of the
<br />
finger...  That from running my finger along the motorstick without
<br />
the boron glued down tight enough at the end...
<br />
<br />Since I'm so paranoid about the stuff, I always use a piece of white
<br />
foamboard to cut it on...  I put a piece of clear tape folded around
<br />
the boron with the center of the tape where I want to break it, and
<br />
then just take the back of a blade and press down enough to snap it...
<br />
&nbsp;Then pull out the piece from the tape (both ends...) and I always can
<br />
see the broken parts left in the tape...  Before I started doing that,
<br />
I had little shards on the foamboard, and picked them up with tape,
<br />
but I don't seem to ever have any anymore...  Then I have a coffee can
<br />
that I throw the tape in, and any short pieces that aren't useful for
<br />
anything I put in a plastic tube and keep that in the can also... 
<br />
longer pieces go back in a longer tube just like the shipping tubes...
<br />
&nbsp;Eventually, I will probably tape off the lid of the can and throw it
<br />
out, or I guess if you really wanted to be safe for everyone (trash
<br />
guys...) you could cast it full of plaster or something...
<br />
<br />I can get the length within 1/16&quot; or so of what I want this way, which
<br />
seems to be fine, and at least I feel better about the stuff...  
<br />
<br />I do think (especially at USIC) about it when getting a plane out
<br />
&quot;goes bad&quot;...  Two years ago I got a PP stuck and pulled it out, and
<br />
it came down (with me looking right up at it...) in pieces and it had
<br />
boron on the wing spars and the motorstick, and when it came down on
<br />
top of me, the wing was all trashed and quite a bit of the boron was
<br />
missing on the spars and on the snapped motorstick...  (I wasn't
<br />
thinking about the boron until I realized it when I was picking up the
<br />
pieces...)  
<br />
<br />The moral part that Mark talked about comes into play there, as it is
<br />
impossible to find it in a case like that, and who knows who could
<br />
step on it...
<br />
