A Braced EZB Challenge: Glory, Fun, and Fortune
<br />
<br />Rules:
<br />
<br />This challenge allows the use of wood bracing to be added to the solid wood motor stick of the EZB.   The intent of this proposal is to remove the frustration of the weak motor stick so the EZB flier can focus on other aspects required for advanced EZB flying.
<br />
<br />1. For any braced EZB model that passes the 30-minute mark, the flier will be added to the 30-minute EZB Club of &quot;A History of EZB Flights.&quot;  You will also receive $100 if your model weighs 0.6 g or above and $75 if your model weighs less than 0.6 g.  (One prize per person per model weight class.)  Note: if you have already made a previous 30-minute EZB flight, you must build and fly a new model to qualify for the challenge.
<br />
<br />2. The flier who has the highest time in the 0.6g or more weight class will receive an additional $250 -- his flight time must be 31:00 or more.  The flier who has the highest time in the sub 0.6g class will also receive an additional $250 -- his flight time must be 32:30 or more.
<br />
<br />3. If your EZB breaks an AMA Open record (Cat I, II, III, IV), you will be added to the Record Club of &quot;A History of EZB Flights.&quot;  In addition, you will receive $100.  (One prize per person, per Category)
<br />
<br />4. All flights must be at an AMA-sanctioned (or FAI-sanctioned) contest or record trial.  Processing of model by contest director is required.  Photos of motor stick bracing must be provided.  You must announce your flight attempt to me 7 days prior to your attempt.
<br />
<br />5. Models, bracing techniques, fliers, etc. will all be documented in an article to be submitted to Free Flight Quarterly.  Your glory will be widely known.
<br />
<br />6. The Braced EZB Challenge starts December 15, 2012 and finishes September 30, 2013.
<br />
<br />All rules are subject to change by me at any time, but it is not 
<br />
<br />Background:  The EZB event was originally introduced in 1961 as an entry level event, a &quot;dumbed down&quot; version of the many complex microfilm and paper models flown at that time.  It quickly gained popularity because it was easier and quicker to build.   At first, the EZB model weighed around 2.0 g, and it was a sturdy model.  Competition pressure would quickly bring the weight down.  In 1968, Jim Richmond's Kokomo Bomber EZB weighed a svelt 0.74g.  Model weights remained in the 0.75 g to 1.2 g range for the next 25 years.  In the mid 1990's Larry Coslick brought down the EZB weight to nearly 0.5 g.  Throughout the 1990's, the EZB was often the most popular event flown at USIC, with nearly 100 contestants.
<br />
<br />Today, the EZB is not a popular event.  It is one of the least popular events.  In order to be competitive at the national level, an EZB must weigh 0.45 g or less.   Larry Coslick, Jim Richmond, Max Zaluska, and Yuan Kang Lee have successfully flown 0.3 g EZBs at national contests.  Recently, the AMA Cat IV record was set using a 0.24 g EZB.
<br />
<br />The EZB model becomes more challenging to build and fly when it is around 0.5g and below.  Many can't or decide not to build so light.  But perhaps a bigger challenge is that the light EZB is often plagued by a motor stick that is not stiff enough and suffers under higher torque launch conditions.  Instead of being a positive challenge, the weak motor stick becomes a source of frustration and a barrier to continued effort.
<br />
<br />By rule, the EZB motor stick must be solid wood, which means bracing is not allowed.  This rule makes the EZB motor stick easy to build.  But there is a caveat.  You can't just use any motor stick you cut up -- you have to go through many candidate sticks before you find one light and strong enough.  We have heard of the travails of many EZB fliers who have gone through hundreds of motor sticks before finding one that is good enough.  
<br />
<br />In contrast, an expert event like F1D uses a rolled motor tube for light weight, and the use of boron and bracing for added stiffness.  The resulting motor stick is light and incredibly stiff.  I have never heard of a F1D builder who has to go through hundreds of rolled tubes to find one that is stiff enough.  In fact, almost every rolled tube is sufficiently stiff once it is reinforced with boron and tightened with bracing.
<br />
<br />This challenge allows the use of wood bracing to be added to the solid wood motor stick of the EZB.   The intent is to remove the frustration of the weak motor stick so the EZB flier can focus on other aspects required for advanced EZB flying.
