<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's a great clip. There seems to be some comedy between the stern guy

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the other timer - what are they saying to each other?
</em><br />
<br />The stern guy is a lieutenant of the air force, supervising the 
<br />
competition. The other guy is a flight mechanic, who will be starring 
<br />
the rest of the movie (along with his pilot), as they participate in an 
<br />
air race on their Blackburn Ripon planes. The joke is mostly that the 
<br />
mechanic is a little too talkative to the lieutenants liking, but later 
<br />
the latter starts to mumble about the flight time, too. A transcription 
<br />
of the clip is something  like this:
<br />
<br /><br />Lieutenant: And now last years champion will fly his new model for the 
<br />
third time. We will soon see, if he can defend his title
<br />
<br />Mechanic: Let's see how the old chap does this time
<br />
Lieutenant: Flight mechanic Suulanen (&quot;big mouth&quot;) should not think aloud!
<br />
Mechanic: Yes sir, lieutenant!
<br />
<br />Lieutenant: It will be over 5 minutes...
<br />
Mechanic: Krmph!
<br />
<br />Lieutenant: it was good.
<br />
<br />Lieutenant: The new model of the champion has beaten the old record by 
<br />
staying aloft for 5 minutes and 25 seconds. Cheers for the champion! 
<br />
Three &quot;Hoorays!&quot;
<br />
Everybody: HOORAY!  HOORAY! HOORAY!
<br />
<br />Lieutenant: It is a pleasure to see the popularity of these model 
<br />
airplane contest among both the contestants and the audience. I hope 
<br />
this will further develop, as through this kind of contests will 
<br />
aviation as sport be promoted especially among the youth, encouraging 
<br />
them to conquer the skies for their fatherland as active pilots in both 
<br />
civil and military aviation.
<br />
<br />Lieutenant: And now boys, let's go!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The scene might be staged, but there is no doubt that is well built and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trimmed model.
</em><br />
<br />It definately seems staged, as the site seems quite small to fly for 5 
<br />
minutes. I have been trying to figure out what the site is (I think it 
<br />
should be in Helsinki), but so far to avail.
<br />
<br />I was given a book (or a booklet) of building indoor models, written in 
<br />
30-something by Aimo Siro, and it has a couple of drawings of his 
<br />
design, too. The plane in the film has great resemblance to them 
<br />
(although it is not exactly like none of them, but rather combines 
<br />
features from 2 models), so I am convinced that the model is built by A. 
<br />
Siro. That 5 minutes is about the duration they got from their models at 
<br />
that time.
