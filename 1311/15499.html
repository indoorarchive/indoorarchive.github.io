Gang,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Another consideration is that the early April date conflicts with the Round Valley Dome indoor contest.  The RVD contest has locked in the dates for quite a while now.  The same was the case this past April with the RVD and WB events conflicting.  I have asked Bill if fall dates may be available for WB as we seem to lack fall indoor events.

&nbsp;I'm with Ben. If we can have the contest,  we need to go in the hopes of future having contests there. We pay about half the rent that normal groups do, so we should not get our feelings hurt when the move us when they get better offers. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I would still be there for the new dates.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The April dates conflict with the WMC 2 day contest so I wouldn't attend West Baden regardless, but this also leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  Perhaps that's because I'm out some cash, but I also don't like that our money apparently isn't as good as some other group's money.  I find it hard to believe they unknowingly double booked an entire weekend.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good thing i didn't book my rooms or anything yet. April dates would be fine with me. Its too bad that the US team will not be able to participate, however IMHO for us to book West Baden this year, show up, book some rooms, and give a good show, etc will be very important to maintaining a good relationship with the staff there. If we want to have this site in the future, esp for a possible WC venue, we should not pass up the opportunity to have a contest there no matter the conflict.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yeah, let's do it! I might stand a chance at placing in F1D! LOL.

&nbsp;If you have it, I will be there. The site is too good to pass up.

<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; After all the effort that has been expended setting up the West Baden contest the hotel has decided that we can't have the weekend of May 2, 3 and 4. Apparently the space was double booked for that weekend and we were the ones who had to give it up.

<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;

<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; The ONLY weekend available for next year is April 5 and 6 with a possibility to add Monday, April 7. This weekend conflicts with the World Championships which would eliminate a number of top competitors from attending at West Baden. I personally don't think the April weekend is workable but I'll leave it up to those of you who would like to go ahead with it. Let me know if you would be able to attend on those dates and whether you think doing the event without the entire USA team would be a good idea.

<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Please don't blame me or Walt for this change. We were acting on the original information given to us and thought we had the dates locked in.
