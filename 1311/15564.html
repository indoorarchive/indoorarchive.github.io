The way a rubber chemist described it is that the molecules are joined together but not in an orderly fashion. Even though rubber is a polymer and it has a crystalline structure for the molecules to all point in the same direction it must be stretched fairly hard.
<br />
I think the difference between good rubber and bad rubber is that after break in the good rubber has a lot more aligned strings of molecules that the poor rubber.
<br />
&nbsp;What is interesting is the fact that only natural rubber is suitable for winding. Synthetic rubber is totally unsuitable because it just cannot be made to exhibit a polymeric crystalline structure.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I tend to thinking of motors as being more analogous to half-lives than to a light switch. I do not believe that a motor hits a point where it simply transitions from being new to being broken in. I think that after the first hardish wind, the motor may be halfway or two thirds of the way broken in. Then successive winds serve to break it in further. I am basing my theory on observing the change in the loop length after successive windings. The loop elongates most after the first winding but continues to lengthen to a lesser degree with each subsequent winding.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think this is why we historically have seen duration increase as the number uses of a motor increases if nothing else changes.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If I am trying to wind a motor to as close to &quot;max.&quot; as I can, without breaking it, I always wind to torque not turns.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; One other comment. If I wind a motor to &quot;max.&quot; I have about a 50% chance of being able to wind it to &quot;max.&quot; a second time without it breaking.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So you guys wind only to a torque and do not care about actual turn count? I find that amazing. I am just the opposite, I go by turn count then back off to a torque level to regulate the height. So If I want say 1750 launch turns on a motor that can take 2000 I may wind to1850 then back off some turns to get my desired launch torque. If the motor could take 2000 turns, I would not wind to 2000 then back off 250 to 1750. I typically only wind (by turns) past my target minimum required launch turns then back off some to knock off some of the torque. Also any new motor I never fly use until broken in. I take a freshly made motor lube it up generously then say if it would take 2000 turns I wind it to ~1750 or so then unwind and measure the length to see if it stretched, a 14&quot;: loop would be like ~14.7&quot; after a break in then I relube and then use that for my flights. Once I do that process and the motor takes a stretch set, the motor is rather consistent over the windings for the day if you done push it too hard. The only time it starts to deviate is if I really push the motor hard multiple times in a row. If I find my model is needing near max turns on each flight and I wind to near max turns on each flight and then say it hangs up, and then I wind max again and hang again, then do it again I find the motor will sag and drop off on these subsequent windings. So I then set that motor aside for a while or make up a new one. Sometimes the &quot;sagging&quot; model will do equal time from less height sometimes it does less time as the model will not climb as high. I noticed this on Nocal a lot as the rules require 3 of 3 flights so often in a contest you take all three in a row and if you are leaning on the motor the first flight, the second flight will be within a few seconds but the third flight will always not climb as high and will either so the same time or sometimes less so on the third flight I usually do not back off as much as I know this will happen. I can usually also tell it is sagging when I start to back off. A sagging motor will drop torque quickly with a few unwinds which is something it did not before.  I may have needed 100 unwinds to get my torque but after 3 or 4 full winds of the rubber only 50 backoff gets the same torque then I know the motor is toasted for the day.
