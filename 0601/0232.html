Nicholas,
<br />
The wood you describe sounds a lot like the recent (2-3 years) sheet 
<br />
stock I've seen for &quot;Very Light&quot; (4# - 6#) from Sig (Solarbo). It's 
<br />
pretty bad generally with bowed plain-sawn grain (compression/tension 
<br />
wood), mostly well over 6#, and all the light sheets are checked. I 
<br />
picked up a couple of the more decent pieces because the shop owner 
<br />
made a special effort to stock it for my convenience. Strips were 
<br />
twisted, and bowed badly. Restock material has only gotten worse since 
<br />
sheets are bundled as cut from individual planks.
<br />
<br />The &quot;checks&quot; I see aren't generally visible until the face of the sheet 
<br />
is positioned at an angle to light; flourescent light in my work area 
<br />
and most commercial light. They are much easier to see in &quot;c&quot; and 
<br />
quarter grain faces and far more common in lighter density wood. These 
<br />
checks show up as very fine, white, lint-like lines crossing the grain; 
<br />
much like fiber filaments in carpet thread.
<br />
<br />If you can work around them, cut out and throw away the checked 
<br />
sections. A strip will always break at these checks, or I missed one. 
<br />
Usually, I try to keep the integrity of the shop sheet so will mark the 
<br />
checks with a highlighter pen. It's best to pass over these sheets at 
<br />
the shop bin, but I'm a repeat customer and often leave with a lighter 
<br />
wallet and the bad sheet. They usually are very attractive 
<br />
superficially.
<br />
<br />The plank my stiffest wood is from has both one of these cracks I'm 
<br />
aware of and a &quot;dimple&quot; which may be where the tree bent and the grain 
<br />
was crushed; much like bending a strip which kinks from too much grain 
<br />
compression. I've gotten into the habit of testing spar wood from a new 
<br />
sheet by sacrificing two or three strips to identify any localized weak 
<br />
points. I find it extremely hard to see checks in a and b grain, thus 
<br />
the sacrifice.
<br />
<br />I'm not convinced that the checks are a result of wind damage, felling 
<br />
trauma, or my own ambitious buckling tests. I feel they are a result of 
<br />
improper drying and lighter densities are more prone to checking as the 
<br />
log, or billet, shrinks. This is a common consideration in any 
<br />
commercial wood drying process. Tim G. would see this more, but I had 
<br />
one billet with a yard cut severely checked on the surface and decent 
<br />
wood about 1 inch into the plank. Nature tends to heal itself and any 
<br />
natural injury would have evidence of repair. I don't see this in any 
<br />
checked wood I have.
<br />
<br />The darker cracks Don described sound like actual cracks created during 
<br />
felling or in live wood. I don't see these very much, but they are 
<br />
pretty visible due to mineral deposition. 
<br />
<br />Good building,
<br />
Bruce in Seattle
