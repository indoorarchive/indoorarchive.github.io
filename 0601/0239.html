Mark,
<br />
<br />Since you posted here I will answer here.
<br />
<br />I dont recall ever hosting a ministick postal in the past so not sure 
<br />
where Jeff got that one from . If Jeff said I made it then I can dig in 
<br />
and tell you how I calculated it. I recall at one time graphing the 
<br />
ministick postal flight times vs ceiling height and may have adjusted 
<br />
the constants that Bud Tenny created to fit a ministick better than the 
<br />
factor use to be. I recall that a 22 minute ministick flight in 120 feet 
<br />
would be beaten by a 6 minute flight in 8 feet. I thought that was 
<br />
wrong.  The other linear fudge factors are the ones I used for years for 
<br />
the other events and are based on actual flight results and a 
<br />
compilation of contest results and current AMA records. I graphed them 
<br />
and found a rough linear relationship for ceilings less than 60ft and 
<br />
that is what I used. Very rarely did a person fly in a postal in a 
<br />
ceiling higher than about 50 feet.
<br />
<br />The EZB factor was determined during the USA vs Japan postal. Having 
<br />
flown a lot of Cat I EZB at the time, I knew how long a flight would 
<br />
last based on the time it touched the ceiling last. If I scrubbed for 15 
<br />
minutes then I would get a 20 minute flight. If I scrubbed for 12 I got 
<br />
17. It was always 5 minutes for a 20 foot drop. So in a 10 foot site the 
<br />
model still scrubbed for 15 minutes, but only got 2 more coming down. So 
<br />
a 17 minute flight in 10 feet equaled  20 in a 20 ft site. A 1 ft site 
<br />
would get 16 minutes.  That is the logic I used . If a HLG drops one 
<br />
second per foot, and the ceiling is 10 feet higher, you can expect in 
<br />
reason that the flight time will be about 10 seconds higher (plus a 
<br />
little more for climb). That is the math and reason behind it. I felt it 
<br />
better to customize the fudge tp each event instead of the universal 
<br />
blanket factor which is plain wrong but was used so many years. You may 
<br />
recall in the past I used to make the fudge factor about half way 
<br />
through the postal once flight times were entered for new events. There 
<br />
is no way to equate it exactly, you can then argue for fudge factors for 
<br />
altitude and temperature, then you go crazy. I figured used real flights 
<br />
and graphng it and seeing what fell out was the best approach, and I 
<br />
will say I think they are close based on past postals and how close they 
<br />
have been in the past. Especially on HLG and CLG, the competition was 
<br />
great the past few years, guys squeezing in the extra few tenths to get 
<br />
the high time. That told me the factors were good. I never had to deal 
<br />
with competative high ceiling height flight times in any of the postals. 
<br />
Most guys are in a 20 to 30 ft gym. Not a 150ft hangar. So I am not sure 
<br />
if the linear factors hold up for sites like USIC.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps.
<br />
Don
<br />
<br />.
