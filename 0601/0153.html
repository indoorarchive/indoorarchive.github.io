AMA Record Trial 12/01/05
<br />
<br />Hancock High Gym; wooden 43' geodic dome, Cat 11 site
<br />
Weather, 32degree F and blustery 
<br />
Inside air temperature; 75 degrees F at the start of the session 
<br />
Drift;   None at first, but as the air temperature dropped, the 
<br />
drift picked up
<br />
Model;    ROG Stick, Event 214  Model name, &quot;Magic&quot; New unbraced 
<br />
wing design, V/P Prop;  10&quot;D, Low 15P, High 26P, Motor 
<br />
5/99, .028X8.25&quot;,  Winds 1820, Back off 30,  Launch tq;. .085 in. 
<br />
oz. 
<br />
Model specifications;  The projected area of the supporting surfaces
<br />
(s) shall not exceed 30 square inches. No limit on, weight, rubber, 
<br />
prop, or covering. Model has to take off the ground or floor under 
<br />
its own power. 
<br />
<br /><br />The attempt to set a new ROG Stick record started off on the wrong 
<br />
foot, I had checked the model before leaving the house, but found a 
<br />
broken wing tip after removing it from the box. The repair was made, 
<br />
and by the time the glue had dried, the CD, and timers had arrived. 
<br />
After a quick low power test flight to check the trim, the model was 
<br />
ready for the first attempt. This particular model is the best one 
<br />
that I have ever built in regards to taking off the ground. Having 
<br />
said that, on the first flight it got into some ground turbulence 
<br />
about four feet off of the floor, stalled, and tail slid to the 
<br />
floor. It was floundering around on the floor trying to tear the 
<br />
blades off the prop. When I tried to pick up the model, I must have 
<br />
pinched the m/s, and it collapsed. It's repairable, but I had to go 
<br />
to a back up model of the same design that hadn't been flown in 
<br />
quite awhile.
<br />
By the time the second model was ready, the air temperature had 
<br />
dropped to 68 degrees, and the drift had picked up. I used the same 
<br />
prop, rubber, and all the rubber stats listed above. This time the 
<br />
model climbed slowly through some ground turbulence, and was on its 
<br />
way. At six minutes it leveled off at eighteen feet, then started 
<br />
drifting toward the north end of the dome, and a half court 
<br />
basketball goal support arm. It didn't take long to reach the arm, 
<br />
and I had to make a steer to move the model near the center of the 
<br />
floor. The RPM's picked up slightly, and it climbed to about twenty 
<br />
two feet, and then started drifting toward the south end of the 
<br />
building, and another support arm. At ten minutes, I had to make 
<br />
another steer, and this time the model climbed to thirty feet, and 
<br />
stayed there until it started to descend. On three consecutive 
<br />
circles at thirty feet, it hit turbulence that forced it back toward 
<br />
the center of the building. During the decent, it hit some more 
<br />
rough air which caused the model to stall, and tail slide for about 
<br />
six feet. The model dead sticked from ten feet, and landed at 18:23, 
<br />
and there was two seconds of prop stop. The temperature was still 
<br />
dropping, and I decided to call it quits for the night. The old 
<br />
record of 17:07 was set in the same site in 1998. A record 
<br />
application will be sent to the AMA for approval. My best full 
<br />
motor, low ceiling flight with this type of model was done without 
<br />
steering and it only climbed 15'.Unfortunately that 19+ flight was 
<br />
unofficial.
