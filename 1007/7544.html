Thanks, Tim.  I love hearing from those who were first-hand witnesses. I welcome your comments and contributions.
<br />
<br />Do you know how I can get access to Aeromodeller (or other periodicals) articles and results for the British Indoor National Championships?  I would love to read more about its history.  I've read many in INAV from those submitted by Nick Aikman in INAV in the 21st century.
<br />
<br />With respect to the contest that you referred to in Aeromodeller, it appears that the contest was for 1.2g EZBs or F1L, which are different from the USA EZBs in that the USA EZBs don't have a minimum weight limit.  I am not familiar enough with EZB flying outside of the USA to  know how popular the USA EZBs were in Britain in the 1990's and 2000's.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Kang
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks, this is great reading. I think the build up to the 30 min flights is also really interesting. Can I submit this excerpt from Aeromodeller? I happened to be at this event flying a hurriedly built 'Serendipity'  - best time of 16:45... which is still good for me :-)  - but watched as Messrs Barr, Hunt and Bailey flying in good air were doing 10 minutes better...  Bob set a British Record for the class at this meet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sadly, I understand flying at Cardington has been suspended indefinitley due to the condition of the shed and pending plans of the new owners to embark on expensive repair work. Laurie Barr's efforts over countless years to keep the site open to model flying are well known.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Early in the day, the contest leader was Laurie Barr who led the way with two good flights of close to 22 mins, but as the day wore on, his model went `off pattern' and could not handle the extra torque needed to fly high enough to do the required time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   After lunch shed conditions improved and the struggle for the first and second places began to take shape, between Bob Bailey and Bernard Hunt. On his third flight, Bernie made a superb time of 24 mins 6 secs from approx only 80% of the hanger's height. Shortly after, Bob launched a hard wound model which did a couple of stalls before climbing strongly away to end up close to the highest part in the roof. His model was beautifully made and trimmed, and flew slower than anyone else's, and completely out of turns his model landed to establish a new record in the 1.2 gram EZB class of 26 mins 42 secs!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   In the fourth round, Bernie wound harder, and launched with more torque than before, and got his model up under the centre catwalk , just a few feet from touching. After some drift correcting steering, and a long cruise and descent he had responded to Bob with 26 mins 26 secs to take the lead with the best two-flight total at the time. It was now up to Bob Bailey to see what he could do, but Bob made another flawless flight of 26 mins 22 secs to win by a margin of 2 mins 32 secs on the two flight total.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Of consuming interest is the apparent improvement in performance brought about by the use of `angled' tip fins on the tailplane, as used by Bob and Bernie. The explanation put forward, is that the `winglets', although they have to be included as projected area in the restricted amount of tail area allowed under the rules, enhance the performance of the lifting properties of the tail, which with the long `tandem' type of model, makes such a large contribution to the overall lifting ability of the model.
