Thanks, John! Great to hear about you and Brett and the HUGE turnout.  In any case, it's great to hear a first hand account of flying.
<br />
<br />Good luck to you guys in Serbia.  It would be great if we had round by round *live* results on the internet.  I guess a really easy way would be for the team managers to send out tweets, if internet access were available.
<br />
<br />Take care.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Could someone post results and/or write-ups on Kibbie Dome over July 4th and on Lakehurst this past weekend?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lakehurst last weekend was HUGE.  There was me, Sanborn, Kagan, Brett, and a full two thirds of the F1D team.  (ok, it was just me and Brett &#x2013; but the flying was great).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Temps were in the upper 80's and low 90's.  Great practice for Serbia, if the weather conditions from last trip are any indication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We didn't do any full motor flights.  It was windy outside, and in a bad direction for the hanger &#x2013; big turbulence at certain altitudes.  But partial motors were decent most of the time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I got my model line-up and prop selection sorted out for the WC, and everything is snug back in the refurbished travel box.  Brett did a long series of very promising partial motor flight.  He has a little repair work to do, but at least the weak points were highlighted before the trip.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jeff Hood and Jeff Daulton came out to keep us company and take pictures on Sunday, but didn't fly anything.  Well, Daulton had a catapult glider &#x2013; but what it did was only vaguely related to flying.  It's on a roof now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Zaluska threatened to show up late on Saturday, but would only have had a few hours and had work to do on Sunday.  Iaco was MIA...probably working on his chopper.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Apparently the big doors were open earlier in the morning.  They run a bunch of diesel motors in the hanger and open the doors to vent the place.  The doors were closed when we arrived, and we wouldn't have even known if an R/C pilot hadn't informed us.  Maybe this door routine happens all the time.
