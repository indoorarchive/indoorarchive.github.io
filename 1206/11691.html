I can appreciate that...the wonderment of any form of free flight, indoor  
<br />
or out, is what lights your rocket.  I had never been exposed to  indoor 
<br />
except thru what I saw on the cover of a Model Airplane News some 50  years 
<br />
ago.  I just did not know where to go from there.  The activity  was dominated 
<br />
by FF gas, and those guys were all around.  My time and money  wasn't 
<br />
competing with much else except for Little League Baseball.  Today,  it's a whole 
<br />
lot easier to not build an indoor model, or any other model for  that matter.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The activity has to be readily available too.  Local indoor flying  clubs 
<br />
have to be discovered or located.  My experience with S/O and TSA  says that 
<br />
the kids kind of say &quot;Gee, that was fun..&quot; but encouraging them to be  an 
<br />
indoor flyer...well, we are lucky to have a local activity to guide them  to.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Perhaps in each article the link to the NFFS clubs or the indoor web sites  
<br />
is in order.  We have a young fellow that found us through our web  
<br />
advertising and is now sold on FF.  We, as a club of course, did everything  we 
<br />
could to help him out and find all those &quot;wonderment's.&quot;   He's hooked  on 
<br />
Indoor and Outdoor, but our club has been pretty progressive in nurturing him  
<br />
too.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
In the Digest we are preaching to the choir.  How does one get the  word 
<br />
out to the masses?  That's the rub.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Too many times we say &quot;here's some stuff&quot; and never follow up with the  
<br />
youth of today, or others for that matter.  It's a lot of work and the  returns 
<br />
aren't that great.  The Don DeLoach's of the world are more of what  is 
<br />
needed, right Don?

<br /><br />But that's how I did it, as a  beginner.  Not from an magazine 
<br />
article--those were only attractive after  I saw the real thing fly, in real time.  
<br />
Otherwise, one can only imagine  how indoor models fly, and probably 
<br />
inaccurately.
