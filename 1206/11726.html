My recollection is that thus group was renamed a number of years ago
<br />
because of fights breaking out over rules. I believe the renaming of the
<br />
group was intended to focus discussions on the actual building and flying
<br />
of indoor models.  (Mark correct me if I'm wrong about this).
<br />
<br />I would personally like to see an adherence to this (extreme?) idea. I
<br />
really don't care to try to post anything here when it's likely that
<br />
another off topic fight is about to break out.
<br />
<br />I also think it's asinine to try to convince outdoor flyers to fly indoor
<br />
freeflight. Every outdoor flyer I know is fully aware of indoor . If they
<br />
want  to fly indoor competitively or just for fun then there's nothing
<br />
stopping them from doing it.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I presume you are also speaking for yourself, and also for &quot;Murph.&quot; In no
</em><br />
way is it unwise to reject a perfectly elegant and descriptive word due to
<br />
your belief that such a word is not attractive enough and does not
<br />
adequately tap dance for newcomers. If I were to run across a group calling
<br />
themselves &quot;The Mulvihists&quot;, I would note, &quot;Wow, here's who I need to talk
<br />
to if and when I want to try Mulvihill.&quot; Some people today crave genuine
<br />
description and truth instead of marketing PR hype (your profession?) IF
<br />
you want to package indoor differently, that's fine, do so, but when you
<br />
continue to insist that everyone else needs to package it the way you and
<br />
MMM wisdom dictates, then we will continue to fight you with words, since
<br />
you are relentless also. One problem is, too much of such pulls down the
<br />
overall interest of Indoor_Construction among those who check here. And a
<br />
few people who do offer indoor content, such as Don S, get mad and leave
<br />
(for the third time, now.) It's interesting to see how much power and
<br />
influence each side ascribes to each other, when really that much power
<br />
doesn't exist, and none of this in-fighting has much effect except on our
<br />
nerves.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my little world, the antidote for bad ideas or analysis is to counter
</em><br />
them with good ideas and better analysis. However, I throw this problem to
<br />
the wisdom of this group (EXCLUDING the 2 Dons,) since in last bad thread 3
<br />
members decided they were the moderator anyhow. What should be done about
<br />
these existential arguements? Does it come down to the personalities
<br />
involved? Should anyone be banned? If you propose new rule, how would you
<br />
enforce it? Private mails are safer, perhaps. But whatever....
