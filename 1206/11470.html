<br />
Gary,
<br />
<br />I believe the rule you are asking to be applied is the following FAC rule:
<br />
<br />*F. Models must closely resemble the full-scale aircraft with respect to 
<br />
outline and proportions. The general
<br />
outline of all surfaces and fuselage cross sections must be retained. 
<br />
The opinion of the judges in this matter
<br />
is final!*
<br />
<br />However that rule is only listed under Section III: FAC SCALE EVENTS 
<br />
(Scale Judged / Timed)
<br />
<br />which then goes on to say:
<br />
<br />*1.0 FAC RUBBER POWERED SCALE (RPS)
<br />
Competition for scale-judged / timed rubber powered models, which 
<br />
includes the following events:
<br />
#1 FAC Peanut Scale #3 FAC Jumbo Scale
<br />
#2 FAC Rubber Scale #4 FAC Pioneer Scale*
<br />
<br />No cal is not included in this list. If the scale outline rule was 
<br />
stated in section II, then it would apply to Nocal, Section II reads as 
<br />
follows:
<br />
<br />*II. PRIMARY RULES: All events
<br />
PRIMARY RULES apply to ALL MODELS in ALL FAC events, unless specified 
<br />
otherwise in the rules for
<br />
a specific event.
<br />
*
<br />
<br />But there is no scale outline rule that applies to all events. The FAC 
<br />
rulebook use to be quite confusing in layout but the latest revisions 
<br />
they did on this past rulebook make it all very clear now and easier to 
<br />
understand. I think if you compare a 3 view to any published no cal plan 
<br />
you will find almost all have had liberties taken on the outlines and 
<br />
layout. The rule really has to be that way because some full size planes 
<br />
are very difficult to model as a flat fuselage. A Spitfire has a huge 
<br />
wing fillet, is that part of the wing or is it not part of the wing? 
<br />
What if you built an F-18? Do the strakes count as wing or do they get 
<br />
flattened with the fuselage? Jack McGillivray is the one who educated me 
<br />
when I first started flying Nocal back in the mid 1980s on how to &quot;size&quot; 
<br />
a 3 view for nocal by telling me to enlarge the 3 view until the wing 
<br />
when measured from the side of the fuselage stuck out 8&quot; not scale the 3 
<br />
view until the wing was 16&quot; span then flatten the fuselage. His method 
<br />
was to flatten the fuselage first on the 3 view then scale it up to 16&quot; 
<br />
span. You gained wing area and fuselage length by doing that. I recall 
<br />
he use to fly a peanut Spitfire in WWI mass launch that had flat 
<br />
fuselage sides and bottom which was not scale cross section at all. The 
<br />
rules did not require scale cross section at the time for mass launch 
<br />
events so he made it easier to build as a box with a turtledeck on the top.
<br />

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  I would be in favor of strict enforcement of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; dimensional requirements &amp; conformance to the original airplanes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; proportions.
