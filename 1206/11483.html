A lot of interesting things being brought up. But let's face it.  
<br />
There will ALWAYS be better builders and flyers and they will tend to  
<br />
win most of the time and rightly so because of their efforts,  
<br />
regardless of whatever rules are in effect at the time. This applies  
<br />
to both indoor and outdoor. Most of us can only work on trying to  
<br />
close the gap for personal satisfaction and when this is successful  
<br />
one feels great for a long time while trying to lessen the gap some  
<br />
more.
<br />
<br />The biggest problem with rules is that they need to be universal and  
<br />
not different locally. Really major problems seem to be cleared up  
<br />
quickly, at least most of the time.
<br />
<br />I think (like) minimum weights in some classes such as A-6. And look  
<br />
what happened to EZB when it changed to 1.2 grams and was then called  
<br />
F1L, rapidly becoming one of the most popular classes ever. Meanwhile  
<br />
the &quot;die-hards&quot; are able to flirt with sub .4 gram models and  
<br />
continue to impress the rest of us.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as well? How about indoor dime scale models that fly 3+ minutes. Do  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you propose min weights on indoor peanut scale, dimes scale etc?  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How about banning 3+ minute indoor Phantom Flashes? So if you want  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to ban the event why not just ban all FAC events for indoor and add  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more time for indoor duration events.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I understand the FAC rules are really meant for outdoor models but  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is naive to think that if the same event is flown indoors that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; special models would not be made and special building techniques  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will not be adapted by the people who will be flying the event, and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those people ARE indoor duration modelers. The reality is that the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people who fly indoor Nocal are those who are already going to the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indoor contest and are looking for another event to fly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indoor duration models are different from outdoor duration models  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so an indoor Nocal is built different from an outdoor nocal just  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like F1D is built different from F1B. What I see at many indoor  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meets is that those flying the FAC events bring their outdoor  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; models inside, and that is their choice. So if that is all the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effort they wish to put into the event then so be it.  But then  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they risk loosing to a model built specifically for indoor flying.   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How many people can build a 5 gram peanut scale Spitfire or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mustang? Jack McGillvray could do just about 3 minutes indoor with  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that model in WWII combat and won just about every time I saw him  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fly it. Why did no one say Jack was ruining the event? Jack had the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first Cessnal Cardinal Nocal and cleaned out clocks at a meet in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Detroit with 7+ minute flights in Nocal? Why was it OK for Jack to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do all this stuff? I was under the impression Jack was highly  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regarded in the FAC, seems to be a double standard here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; As for grossly fudging outlines, that’s a disgrace. I saw a Lacy  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No-Cal built by a well-known indoor flier, now deceased, allowed  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to fly at West Baden years ago sporting a motor stick that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; protruded three or four inches beyond the model’s nose! Ridiculous!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This issue was addressed and is not allowed in the current Nocal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rules.
