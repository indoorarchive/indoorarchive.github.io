But would it not open up the field to more than just one or two top designs?
<br />
Which is the point.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Why do you assume I want to legislate sport flyers into the winner's circle?
<br />
Of course the best flyers will always win. Changing perception is far more
<br />
important. The average guy want to look at an event and see a) a variety of
<br />
models represented and b) a reasonable set of rules that they can build to
<br />
and c) a reasonable chance of doing at least close to the middle of pack in
<br />
duration.

<br />
<br /><br />4 or 5 gram indoor Nocal with 60 sq inches and 7&quot; props will do 5 minutes at
<br />
Kent and 7+ at USIC. So it really changes nothing except the indoorists will
<br />
know how to do it and the FAC sport guy will not and will still loose. I
<br />
don't see how that makes it all OK somehow? The same guys will win just like
<br />
the same guys win when the 6.2 gr was added, they just adapted. There will
<br />
always be a gap between the sport flyer and the competitive flyer and trying
<br />
to legislate people into the winners circle has never worked in timed indoor
<br />
events , be them AMA or FAC.

<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Now we're getting somewhere!
<br />
<br /><br />Please tell me 
<br />
1) What specific weight. I agree with you that heavy, clunky models are not
<br />
ideal for indoor flying, if for no other reason than they don't mesh well
<br />
with even our heavyweights light PP and LPP. That said, we need a reasonable
<br />
number that is not too heavy and not too light. I'd say 4-5 grams is about
<br />
right. (our 6.2 gr WWII event is fun but really a gram or two too heavy. The
<br />
models are a tad fast and almost all of them have needed ballast)
<br />
2) what specific prop diameter. Well, this is a scale model, so let's keep
<br />
it pretty small to add to realism. 7&quot; seems right. 
<br />
<br />The additional rule that is probably needed is a length limit, like 16&quot;, but
<br />
on further thought it might be better to drop the wingspan restriction and
<br />
just limit wing area to something like 60 sq. inches. If the latter, perhaps
<br />
we wouldn't need a wingspan restriction.
<br />
<br />All of this goes a long way toward eliminating the buzz-kill loopholes while
<br />
keeping the event within reach for the average FAC builder.
<br />
<br />But it also goes a long way down the path of over-legislating which FAC is
<br />
loathe to do. Still, I've been told the FAC Council is monitoring this
<br />
discussion, so maybe they'll discuss it at their next rules meeting.
<br />
<br />Will satisfy the &quot;spirit of the FAC&quot; nocal event?    
<br />
