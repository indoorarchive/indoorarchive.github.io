Once again we must be on different wavelengths..  My telling Donny  &quot;Not to saddle up for second place &quot; just means ...if it's worth doing do your best    ...Win or lose  Mediocrity will not win ...IN contests  or life... For a long time Donny lost every contest  he entered  but I told him to just beat your  previous time . that was your contest eventually he started to win and I can honestly say I never built any of his planes Now he can hold his own at any contest. I'm proud of what he's accomplished as a modeler and engineer. That's what don't saddle up for second means to us. I hope I might have cleared it up for you a bit ;-) 
<br />
<br />good luck 
<br />

PS we got lots of 2nd 3,4 and 5th  places No shame in that ... but around here it just inspires us to try harder next time ;-)

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;John Kagan told us:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;“Some people, like the average FACer, simply enjoy flying a model for fun - other people, like you, me, and Don S., enjoy trying to do our best with said model. So, why is it that the fun-flyers get upset with those who enjoy trying to get the most out of a plane?”
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You went on to give us this: “...those who enjoy trying to get the most out of a plane?” Hmm... so FAC guys don’t really want their models to fly their best? What was that? John, perhaps you should have hung around Glastonbury a few more years so you could grasp the true “state-of-mind” of the FAC. Sure, we FAC members have fun, but a good share are as competitive as most of your “indoorists.” I certainly won’t be going to the FAC Nationals in July just to schmooze with old pals and throw up a few flights just for the fun of it. I, like most, want to bring home a trophy (Heaven forbid, it could even be for 2, 3, 4, or 5th place!). If it were not for competitions such as this, I doubt I’d be building much in the way of free flight, indoors or out. I’d guess the majority of FAC competitors feel the same way. We just take winning or losing mostly with a smile on our faces, not honoring a slogan like “never saddle up for second place.” (Did Vince Lombardi fly indoor?) There’s nothing to be ashamed of getting second place at the FAC Nationals, or at just about any free flight contest, indoors or out. For Pete’s sake, this a hobby, not a life-and-death struggle for personal supremacy!
