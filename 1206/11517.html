<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You summarized my thesis as &quot;the validity of ones hobby is based 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purely on paid memberships&quot;. I did not say that.
</em><br />
<br />Not directly but here is how I inferred it. You originally posted:
<br />
*
<br />
*
<br />
*&quot;With due respect if you and Don can't see the absurdity of a 12&quot; prop 
<br />
on a 16&quot; span scale model then I don't know what to say. *
<br />
*FAC ain't for everyone, and it's not perfect either. But around 1800 
<br />
paid members seem to agree it's a pretty good thing. *
<br />
*How many of those 1800 are inspired by watching 2 gram no cals flop 
<br />
around the gym at one-tenth scale speed?&quot;*
<br />
<br />It is then implied that the 1800 paid members in FAC outweigh the two of 
<br />
us, so you have 1800 on your side, we are only two. Then you comment on 
<br />
how a 2 gram nocal is essentially unimpressive in the last sentence. So 
<br />
therefore what were are doing is &quot;wrong&quot; as it is not what the 1800 
<br />
others are doing. So I then concluded that you placed paid memberships 
<br />
of 1800 people in higher regard than what we are doing. They are right 
<br />
we are wrong. I then took that to the next step which was to compare 
<br />
&quot;free flight&quot; as a whole to RC as whole.
<br />
<br />By the way I find the 1/10 scale speed comment interesting, and yes I 
<br />
know it was tongue in cheek, but for a quick exercise, a Fike or Lacey 
<br />
built to 3 grams will need about 2 grams of rubber to fly so 5 gram in 
<br />
weight, that calcs out to about 3.42 mph flying speed and the models 
<br />
would be about ~1/20th scale at 16&quot; span so 20*3.42mph ~75 mph which is 
<br />
a reasonable cruise speed for a homebuilt. My 2 gram Cessna Cardinal 
<br />
with its smaller wing flies faster at 5.08mph and is 1:26.6 scale so it 
<br />
is flying at 135mph scale speed and the full size one cruises at 143 
<br />
mph.  So not as far off as one would think :-)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obviously there are other factors involved. But membership numbers do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tell an interesting story, don't you think?
</em><br />
<br />All it tells me is how many people participate in the activity. It says 
<br />
nothing about the validity of the activity. Lots of people play golf but 
<br />
that does not mean it is a better activity than say a guy with a metal 
<br />
detector walking a beach. *
<br />
*
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But let's not make this a contrast between FAC and indoor duration, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because that's a horrible mismatch.
</em><br />
<br />But that is the whole debate isn't it? You treat FAC events flown 
<br />
indoors as if they are still outdoor events. They are not, when flown 
<br />
inside they are now indoor duration events. You say a 12&quot; prop on an 
<br />
indoor Nocal is absurd but at an indoor contest 7&quot; span ministicks have 
<br />
7&quot; props, OPP has 18&quot; span and 17&quot; props and that is the norm for 
<br />
indoor.  So to an indoor guy that is normal, we have no thermals to 
<br />
speak of. So when an FAC event that is scored purely on duration is 
<br />
flown indoors the indoor duration modelers who fly this event will apply 
<br />
indoor techniques and practices to the event. If you want nocal to have 
<br />
plastic props and solid motorsticks then get the FAC to change the rules 
<br />
so the indoor guys will have to fly the same style models as the outdoor 
<br />
guys do. I have been waiting for that change for years actually and have 
<br />
been surprised that it has not happened yet as was recently done to 
<br />
Phantom Flash. (the one piece plastic prop rule reduced indoor flight 
<br />
times from 4 minutes to about 3 minutes) and if that happens to nocal,  
<br />
expect contest grade motorsticks and scraped down plastic props and then 
<br />
he complains will start up all over again :-)
<br />
<br />Don S.
