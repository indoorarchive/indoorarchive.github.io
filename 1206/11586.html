Gary,
<br />
<br />After last nights discussion I think the best situation for USIC is not 
<br />
to adopt the FAC version of Nocal and continue to fly it as a lone 
<br />
version of Nocal as it has been all along.I do think it would be worth 
<br />
it to try removing the USIC imposed weight limit restriction and see 
<br />
what happens to participation or maybe fly both no weight restriction 
<br />
and 6.2 gram minimum. Kind of like Unlimited catapult and Standard 
<br />
catapult glider are separated and see what happens. Also perhaps 
<br />
renaming it to “Indoor Profile Scale” would also prevent confusion with 
<br />
those thinking it is the same event as the FAC version of Nocal . By 
<br />
removing the FAC association then there is no longer room for any 
<br />
discussion as to the spirit of the event which seems to be intergral in 
<br />
FAC circles. &quot;Indoor Profile Scale&quot;  changes the event to a duration 
<br />
event where large props, light weight, and long flight times are to be 
<br />
expected and though the origins of the event are rooted from the FAC 
<br />
version, this event is a stand alone version which targets the indoorist 
<br />
and the indoorist style of building, flying, and thinking. After all 
<br />
that is who is attending the USIC anyhow so if you want more USIC 
<br />
participation then how about making it appeal to the F1L flyer or F1D 
<br />
flyer who is already there? So nothing really changes at USIC except 
<br />
there is no expectation of trying to conform to the FAC spirit. Conflict 
<br />
eliminated. You process the model as any other indoor event, measure the 
<br />
wingspan, visual inspection of is it recognizable as to what plane it 
<br />
modeled from? Then go fly.
<br />
<br /><br />There was a comment posted yesterday along the lines that if you don’t 
<br />
like the FAC events then don’t fly them, perhaps that really is the best 
<br />
suggestion for indoor nocal, at least as flown at USIC.  So if other 
<br />
indoor contests around the US want to fly indoor FAC Nocal they can, and 
<br />
those that want to fly &quot;Indoor Profile Scale&quot; can as well.
<br />
<br /><br />Don S
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Many people seem to agree that No-Cal as it is flown at the USIC has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolved into a single design event and that participation is low. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since No-Cal is a FAC event &amp; their rules do not include a minimum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weight why not adopt the FAC rules &amp; see if interest increases or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decreases? By the way, this would not eliminate anyone from flying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their Hosslers. It could even be done on a trial basis.
