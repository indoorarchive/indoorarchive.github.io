a short note...my EZB...first attempt...&quot;Hobby Shopper&quot;...was hit smack  in 
<br />
the side by Mr. Romash's RC Zero...the Zero took the shot less than the  
<br />
EZB...lost it's prop and smashed into the floor.  The EZB kept on  flying.  I 
<br />
put a red circle on the side of the motor stick...just to rub it  in.

<br />I  thought I would share a few more of my worthless observations ...
<br />
<br />For  those wondering what Bill Gowen's secret is, I'm going to reveal it to 
<br />
&nbsp;you.  It is simply this: Demolish your competition.
<br />
<br />But  how?
<br />
<br />1. Fly with a heavy prop.  The added moment of inertial cuts  the 
<br />
competition right below the knee.
<br />
<br />2. Make your model  indestructible.  Use carbon spars on your wing, and 
<br />
watch your  competition crumple and crumble.
<br />
<br />3. Do not trim your model to fly nose  up.  If you fly nose up, your prop 
<br />
turns too slowly, and the model flies  too slowly as well.  Fly with your 
<br />
thrust line level with the model's  flight path.  You want maximum momentum on 
<br />
your model while in the  hunt.
<br />
<br />4. Finally, and this is absolutely the key, without which the  previous 
<br />
three tips will be ineffective: Fly your model in a very large  circle, at 
<br />
least 50'.  When you do this, your competition cannot get away  from you.  Like 
<br />
a predator with an expanded hunting range, you increase  the chance of a 
<br />
successful hunt.  If you fly in a smaller 25' circle,  like most unsuccessful 
<br />
fliers, you lower your chance of a successful  hunt.
<br />
<br />The efficacy of these four methods were demonstrated clearly by  Bill 
<br />
Sunday, on his winning 15:22 LPP flight.  Flying in a huge 50' or  60' circle, 
<br />
his LPP left no airspace safe.  First up (or down) was Walt  Collins's 
<br />
silver-mylar-covered LPP.  One moment it was happily taking in  the view from under 
<br />
the louvers, probably on a career flight.  But the  next instant brought 
<br />
its happy moment to a sorrowful end.  Some swear  that they heard machine-gun 
<br />
fire.  I looked up just in time to see the  Silver bird spiral down in 
<br />
spectacular fasion, with black smoke trailing and  all, like a downed WWII plane 
<br />
spiraling into the Pacific.  &quot;Silver&quot; met  its end, and it didn't even know 
<br />
what hit it.
<br />
<br />Having just demolished  Walt's Silver bird, Bill's LPP began looking for 
<br />
its next victim.   Employing the four methods outlined above, Bill's LPP, 
<br />
hereafter referred to  as &quot;Demolition&quot;, did not even alter its flight path.  
<br />
Some swear that  they even saw &quot;Demolition&quot; gain a few feet of altitude, having 
<br />
soaked up the  Soul of the Silver Bird. 
<br />
<br />The next prey was no other than the Brett  Sanborn LPP.  The Sanborn LPP 
<br />
was in second place, only 14 seconds  behind.  The Sanborn LPP circles in a 
<br />
tight 15' circle and nicely avoids  stationary obstacles.  But the real danger 
<br />
in the air was not stationary  and was relentlessly seeking prey.  
<br />
&quot;Demolition&quot; engaged the Sanborn LPP  not long after devouring the Silver Bird.  The 
<br />
first encounter wobbled  the Sanborn LPP. and &quot;Demolition&quot; readied itself 
<br />
for a second pass.  One  large circle later, &quot;Demolition&quot; unleashed its full 
<br />
kinetic energy into the  Sanborn LPP, and the already wounded Sanborn LPP 
<br />
tumbled to the ground like a  downed duck, forever into second place.  
<br />
&quot;Demolition&quot; finished the flight  10 minutes later with a contest-best time of 
<br />
15:22.
<br />
<br />I've revealed the  workings of Bill Gowen's &quot;Demolish&quot; LPP.  Bill has 
<br />
always published the  details of his models, but he did not reveal why they were 
<br />
so.  Now you  know.
<br />
<br />p.s.  Although the Sanborn LPP was hit twice by  &quot;Demolition&quot;, it did not 
<br />
actually tumble to the floor, at least not  physically.  But I believe the 
<br />
encounter left it shattered on the  inside.  All other facts in this story are 
<br />
as they  happened.

last night, I'm feeling  much better.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There were two dominating performers in Rubber  at the 2012: Brett

Sanborn and Bill Gowen.  Brett won hotly contested  battles in F1D and F1L.  Bill 
<br />
won A6, F1M, LPP, and placed 2nd in  F1L.  Brett set a new USIC record with 
<br />
his 36+ minute F1D flight.   Bill blew away the competition in A6 with a 
<br />
mind boggling, national record  11:02.  And no touch.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, we learned earlier that  Kurt Krempetz won the first &quot;Hat

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tom Sova also returns home with three wins in  Intermediate Stick, 35 cm,
