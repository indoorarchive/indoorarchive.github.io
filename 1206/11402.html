I attended the monthly indoor flying session of the San Diego Orbiteers and Scale Staffel.  A contest was held for A6, No-Cal, Phantom Flash, and Embryo.  Guys here prefer covering with tissue.
<br />
<br />I made one 1/4 motor flight with my EZB to test a prop that I intend to use at Kibbie.  After a few near collisions with the heavier models, I put the EZB away.
<br />
<br />Having nothing to fly, I asked if I could borrow someone's A6.  John Hutchison kindly lend me one of his three A6's.
<br />
<br />This A6 was covered with tissue, had many repair scars, and weighed in at 2.9g.  Hmmm.  Is this thing intended to be flown indoor? With this hefty wing loading, is this model going to injure someone?  What size motor should I use?  I pulled out a 1.8g 18&quot; loop (about .080&quot; cross section) from my motor box; this motor was used for Limited Penny Plane a couple of years ago.
<br />
<br />My curiosity was piqued -- what do other people's A6 weigh?  Three other fliers brought their A6's over to get measured.  They weighed 1.8g, 2.4g, and 2.9g. And all three used condenser paper!
<br />
<br />To keep the story short, the 1.8g A6 won the contest with a flight of 2:56.  2nd was the 2.4g A6 with 2:35.  3rd was 1:20.  The gym had a height of 22' and allowed light scrubbing.
<br />
<br />The 2.9 g model I flew, powered with the .080&quot; motor, was able to fly for approximately 3:00, if it did not fly into the wall.  Being the competitive obsessive that I am, I could not accept no-touch flying this thing into second place.  To win, I had to bang the ceiling a bit.  But the ceiling banging inevitably caused the model to go off course and eventually crash into the wall.  The best I could do was about 65 seconds.
<br />
<br />The motor turned the prop at a gentle (sarcasm on) 680 RPM.  Surprisingly, though, the model flew with in a gentle way (no sarcasm).  I wonder how heavy are the models flown by local fliers around the country.  My guess is that very few are flown at 1.2g.
