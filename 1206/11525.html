<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I understand your positions but what you seems to be unable to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand is that FAC No-Cal is /_not an indoor duration event_/. It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is s scale event for recognizable profile models. Flown indoors 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No-cals are of course lighter. The question is how light/slow is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasonable and within the Spirit of FAC.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Then we will never agree on this. An event flown indoors that is scored 
<br />
solely on duration is an indoor duration event. Nocal just happens to be 
<br />
a model that looks like a full size airplane. My appeal to the event is 
<br />
that it is a bride between flying and indoor model and a scale model. 
<br />
With its biggest benefit being no subjectivity of a judge on your 
<br />
scoring which is why my father stopped flying FAC peanut after only two 
<br />
models when the judges would give him a sour look as he placed his Fike 
<br />
peanut on the table and the judge would say &quot;Not another one of those!&quot;
<br />
<br />I have no clue what the &quot;Spirit of FAC&quot; is, but sounds like and exorcism 
<br />
is perhaps in order. If the flight times of indoor nocals are not in the 
<br />
&quot;Spirit&quot; then the FAC keeper of Kanones (I believe) whom all the FAC 
<br />
scores are reported to for the past 20 years would have brought this 
<br />
issue up and changed the rules. Ross Mayo was at indoor events in 
<br />
Buffalo and saw in person 6+ minute Hosler Furys flying. If any single 
<br />
person thought that what we were doing was not in the spirit of the 
<br />
event, Ross would have done something about it. But I believe that he 
<br />
understands that indoor is a whole different ball of wax.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you doubt my, ask a dozen FAC guys at random whether they think a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3-gram No-Cal with a 12&quot; prop is in the spirit of FAC No-Cal. I'll bet 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you $200 to the NFFS Junior Team Fund that a majority will agree with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me that it is most certainly /not/. Will you take that bet?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Will you take that survey at the USIC :-) The &quot;spirit&quot;  of those who fly 
<br />
outside Nocal will differ from the &quot;spirit&quot; who fly solely inside. An 
<br />
interesting note is that Mike Thompson had a 6.2 gr Hosler Fury at USIC 
<br />
that had a very small prop about 7&quot; on it and a very long motor that 
<br />
took a bunch of winds to get the times. So if he won with a 7&quot; prop was 
<br />
that in the spirit of FAC? And then if he then put a 12&quot; prop on it then 
<br />
it is no longer in the spirit of FAC? Seems very subjective.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Keep flying F1Ls disguised as No-Cals all you want.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
&quot;Disguised&quot; is again trying to tag it with a negative connotation 
<br />
because it does not fit into your &quot;spirit&quot; of the event definition but 
<br />
it fit into mine.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I really think every time you do it you are whittling away at the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very spirit of the event and the competitive spirit of your fellow flyers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Take a survey of indoor flyers and see if loosing to a better model 
<br />
makes them want to throw the towel in or does it make them want to 
<br />
sharpen their pencil? I suspect  indoor guys want to sharpen their pencil.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you sleep well knowing that, then, nighty-night.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I sleep well knowing I do my best and not settling for less. &quot;Never 
<br />
saddle up for second&quot; is what my father taught me. And my sleep number 
<br />
is 40. What's yours?
<br />
