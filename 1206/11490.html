<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bob,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I donâ&#x20ac;&#x2122;t particularly appreciate your jumping to such an absurd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conclusion. I mentioned dropping the event partly with tongue in cheek 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and also because it does appear that the popularity of indoor No-Cal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is possibly waning. But I have no problem if you and the (about) ten 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; other guys who can (or want to) build very light models want to keep 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on battling it out indoors.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Guess I did not understand you correctly when you said:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Maybe the event should simply be dropped from indoor competition. &quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I took that to mean that you feel Nocal should be dropped from indoor 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; competition. Seems like a rational conclusion from the statement you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; posted. I have no clue if your being serious or not in your suggestion. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps an emoticon would have helped out.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Whoa! Can we slow down a bit here? Thatâ&#x20ac;&#x2122;s a lot of â&#x20ac;&#x153;bans,â&#x20ac;&#x9d; a word Iâ&#x20ac;&#x2122;ve 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; never considered using regarding model airplane events, including the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ones you mentioned. In any case,â&#x20ac;&#x153;banâ&#x20ac;&#x9d; (your choice of words, not mine) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is a bit severe, donâ&#x20ac;&#x2122;t you think?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dropped or banned what is the difference really if you can't fly the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; event, dropping it from indoor is essentially banning it form being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flown but that is semantics . Anyhow, it was just an extension of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument I was laying out based on my interpretation of your original 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; post in regards to dropping Nocal. The point I was getting at was if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nocals fly too long and needs to be dropped as an indoor event , then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what about other indoor FAC events that fly too long as well when flown 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indoors? Should they be dropped as well? Most can't get 2 minutes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indoors with a Golden Age scale model but when some guys get 4+ minutes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in that event that is OK, that is twice the flight time. But if an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;indoor&quot; guy does 7minutes  with a Nocal that event is &quot;ruined&quot; as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others can only do 5 minutes. So it is OK to fly twice as long in other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events except Nocal.  Where does it end is what I was getting at but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since you were tongue and cheek in your initial comment then my point is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moot now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It was interesting to see you invoke the name of the late, great Jack 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; McGillivray. What does he have to do with a discussion of suggested 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; changes in the No-Cal rules? And what â&#x20ac;&#x153;double standardâ&#x20ac;&#x9d; are you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; talking about?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The reason I mention Jack is he is the person I knew the longest in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regards to FAC events, met him when I was about 12 years old, and he was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the biggest influence on me personally in regards to indoor scale flying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as he was able to make indoor scale models light, fly long and get lots 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of scale points and that appealed to me. The double standard I am 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; referring to when certain FAC guys like Jack for example (as I knew him 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the best) would make a 1.5 gram Cessna Cardinal Nocal, or 5 gram peanut 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scale models, or use gear boxes to get longer flight times, and that was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all OK and in the spirit of FAC when he did it. But when the rest of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indoor duration guys pickup on what was being done, then they were 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somehow ruining the events with their competitive drive, etc.  Jack was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very innovating in adapting FAC events to indoor techniques as well as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ken Groves (laminating tissue layers together to get rid of bulkheads 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and stringer etc, talk about skills needed to make molds etc).  Jack is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the one who told me how to fudge the wings on nocals so I find it funny 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when I now mention the fudging of nocal parts people are appalled by it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but it has been going on for 20+ years and by big time FAC modelers. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Gorden Roberts had a plan for a Spirfitre Nocal that had a triangular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hollow motor stock. That was OK he was a FAC great, but an indoor guys 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rolls a hollow tube for a motorstick and they ruin the event with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; special indoor skills. That is what I was getting at. Don't know else 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how to explain it.
