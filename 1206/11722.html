<br /><br /><br />Don D,
<br />
&lt;&lt;simply unwise&gt;&gt;
<br />
I presume you are also speaking for yourself, and also for &quot;Murph.&quot; In no way is it unwise to reject a perfectly elegant and descriptive word due to your belief that such a word is not attractive enough and does not adequately tap dance for newcomers.  If I were to run across a group calling themselves &quot;The Mulvihists&quot;, I would note, &quot;Wow, here's who I need to talk to if and when I want to try Mulvihill.&quot;  Some people today crave genuine description and truth instead of marketing PR hype (your profession?)  IF you want to package indoor differently, that's fine, do so, but when you continue to insist that everyone else needs to package it the way you and MMM wisdom dictates, then we will continue to fight you with words, since you are relentless also.  One problem is, too much of such pulls down the overall interest of Indoor_Construction among those who check here.  And a few people who do offer indoor content, such as Don S, get mad and leave (for the third time, now.)  It's interesting to see how much power and influence each side ascribes to each other, when really that much power doesn't exist, and none of this in-fighting has much effect except on our nerves. 
<br />
<br />In my little world, the antidote for bad ideas or analysis is to counter them with good ideas and better analysis.  However, I throw this problem to the wisdom of this group (EXCLUDING the 2 Dons,) since in last bad thread 3 members decided they were the moderator anyhow.  What should be done about these existential arguements?  Does it come down to the personalities involved?  Should anyone be banned? If you propose new rule, how would you enforce it? Private mails are safer, perhaps.  But whatever....
<br />
Thanks,
<br />
Mark B
