Hello Ren,
<br />
<br />My Bostonian was in the March 1990 Model Builder as a full size plan, be
<br />
aware it not very competitive anymore. The modern trend toward wider bodies
<br />
and huge lifting stabs made my model obsolete quickly.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />The INAV archive has several competitive choices by Coslick, Aronstein,
<br />
Miller and Thomas.

<br />
<br />Don. S.,
<br />
<br />You have now opened my eyes to something that has impressed the hell out of
<br />
me!!
<br />
<br />You wrote &quot;
<br />
By the way I find the 1/10 scale speed comment interesting, and yes I know
<br />
it was tongue in cheek, but for a quick exercise, a Fike or Lacey built to 3
<br />
grams will need about 2 grams of rubber to fly so 5 gram in weight, that
<br />
calcs out to about 3.42 mph flying speed and the models would be about
<br />
~1/20th scale at 16&quot; span so 20*3.42mph ~75 mph which is a reasonable cruise
<br />
speed for a homebuilt. My 2 gram Cessna Cardinal with its smaller wing flies
<br />
faster at 5.08mph and is 1:26.6 scale so it is flying at 135mph scale speed
<br />
and the full size one cruises at 143 mph.  So not as far off as one would
<br />
think :-)   &quot;.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Does the scaling of speed workout on its own or, do we build to that?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Don D.,
<br />
<br />In the book Indoor Flying Models, I see a Bostonian Celtic designed by you.
<br />
Could you email me privately the measurements of this model and any specific
<br />
information you might deem necessary for me to successfully  replicate this
<br />
model. Please keep in mind it will be my first Bostonian ever.
<br />
<br />Thank you,
<br />
<br />Ren

<br />
<br />You summarized my thesis as &quot;the validity of ones hobby is based purely on
<br />
paid memberships&quot;. I did not say that. 
<br />
<br /><br />Not directly but here is how I inferred it. You originally posted:
<br />
<br />&quot;With due respect if you and Don can't see the absurdity of a 12&quot; prop on a
<br />
16&quot; span scale model then I don't know what to say. 
<br />
<br />FAC ain't for everyone, and it's not perfect either. But around 1800 paid
<br />
members seem to agree it's a pretty good thing. 
<br />
<br />How many of those 1800 are inspired by watching 2 gram no cals flop around
<br />
the gym at one-tenth scale speed?&quot;
<br />
<br />It is then implied that the 1800 paid members in FAC outweigh the two of us,
<br />
so you have 1800 on your side, we are only two. Then you comment on how a 2
<br />
gram nocal is essentially unimpressive in the last sentence. So therefore
<br />
what were are doing is &quot;wrong&quot; as it is not what the 1800 others are doing.
<br />
So I then concluded that you placed paid memberships of 1800 people in
<br />
higher regard than what we are doing. They are right we are wrong. I then
<br />
took that to the next step which was to compare &quot;free flight&quot; as a whole to
<br />
RC as whole. 
<br />
<br />By the way I find the 1/10 scale speed comment interesting, and yes I know
<br />
it was tongue in cheek, but for a quick exercise, a Fike or Lacey built to 3
<br />
grams will need about 2 grams of rubber to fly so 5 gram in weight, that
<br />
calcs out to about 3.42 mph flying speed and the models would be about
<br />
~1/20th scale at 16&quot; span so 20*3.42mph ~75 mph which is a reasonable cruise
<br />
speed for a homebuilt. My 2 gram Cessna Cardinal with its smaller wing flies
<br />
faster at 5.08mph and is 1:26.6 scale so it is flying at 135mph scale speed
<br />
and the full size one cruises at 143 mph.  So not as far off as one would
<br />
think :-)   
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Obviously there are other factors involved. But membership numbers do tell
<br />
an interesting story, don't you think?
<br />
<br /><br />All it tells me is how many people participate in the activity. It says
<br />
nothing about the validity of the activity. Lots of people play golf but
<br />
that does not mean it is a better activity than say a guy with a metal
<br />
detector walking a beach.  
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />But let's not make this a contrast between FAC and indoor duration, because
<br />
that's a horrible mismatch.  
<br />
<br /><br />But that is the whole debate isn't it? You treat FAC events flown indoors as
<br />
if they are still outdoor events. They are not, when flown inside they are
<br />
now indoor duration events. You say a 12&quot; prop on an indoor Nocal is absurd
<br />
but at an indoor contest 7&quot; span ministicks have 7&quot; props, OPP has 18&quot; span
<br />
and 17&quot; props and that is the norm for indoor.  So to an indoor guy that is
<br />
normal, we have no thermals to speak of. So when an FAC event that is scored
<br />
purely on duration is flown indoors the indoor duration modelers who fly
<br />
this event will apply indoor techniques and practices to the event. If you
<br />
want nocal to have plastic props and solid motorsticks then get the FAC to
<br />
change the rules so the indoor guys will have to fly the same style models
<br />
as the outdoor guys do. I have been waiting for that change for years
<br />
actually and have been surprised that it has not happened yet as was
<br />
recently done to Phantom Flash. (the one piece plastic prop rule reduced
<br />
indoor flight times from 4 minutes to about 3 minutes) and if that happens
<br />
to nocal,  expect contest grade motorsticks and scraped down plastic props
<br />
and then he complains will start up all over again :-)
<br />
