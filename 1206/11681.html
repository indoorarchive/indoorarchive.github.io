I see a challenge out there.  Some article that can be put in to  MA and 
<br />
not so impressive that it scares away the potential indoor modeler.   My 
<br />
&quot;first&quot; serious indoor plane was the &quot;Hobby Shopper&quot; pushed to me by Tim  
<br />
Goldstein of A2Z.  He challenged me and I still fly it...of course it  qualifies 
<br />
more for a F1L than a competitive EZB now...all the glue and  repairs.  I 
<br />
documented it in a series of articles in the M&quot;Max-Out&quot; when I  was building it. 
<br />
&nbsp;The target as the first &quot;big time&quot; indoor event in  Colorado Springs 
<br />
sponsored by the MMM Club and Don DeLoach.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
But face it...a newcomer isn't just deciding &quot;Oh, I want to be an indoor  
<br />
flyer!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
A lot of current indoor flyers say that building a lightweight model is a  
<br />
piece of cake, but you target should be the person who wants to try but does 
<br />
not  want to be faced with the daunting challenge of starting at the top.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Success doesn't necessarily mean beating John Kagan or Brett Sanborn.   The 
<br />
guy you want to recruit is the guy who sees Indoor in an article and is  
<br />
enticed, but currently flies AMA FF or maybe CL or hopefully...the disgruntled 
<br />
&nbsp;RC guy.

<br /><br /><br />Maybe it's time for an  update.  The basic idea would be to build a 
<br />
pennyplane from hobby shop  materials with simple tools and offer online assistance 
<br />
through Hippocket or  this Yahoo list.  The goal would be lower the barrier 
<br />
to entry as far as  possible.

I had a Pennyplane construction article published in the March 1975  issue 
<br />
of American Aircraft Modeler which at the time was the AMA magazine.  It was 
<br />
written for a high school English assignment.

<br /><br /><br /><br />Has MA ever printed a comprehensive build article for something like  LPP?  
<br />
That seems like a good place to start if the goal is to get  people 
<br />
interested.  Perhaps a Hobby Shopper LPP?  It could also  include a link to this 
<br />
list so people would have a resource for questions.

<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree whole heartily with Don .If not for John's  column Indoor would

have been totally absent from a Free Flight  edition of MA
<br />

don't exist .Would be like a feature on U-  Control and omitting Speed. events

or combat.Nuff  said.&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Has anyone here, within the last decade,  presented Model Aviation with 
<br />
good indoor content and been  refused?
