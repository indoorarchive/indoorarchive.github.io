<br />
Bill,
<br />
<br />The reason it became that way was to &quot;equalize&quot;  the event. The first 
<br />
time I flew Nocal in the &quot;USIC&quot; in the Niagara Falls convention center 
<br />
there was no weight limit on indoor nocal. Models were in the 3 gram 
<br />
range and people like me, Larry Loucka and my dad could do about 5 
<br />
minutes in no-cal and I think my dad was the first to break 5 minutes 
<br />
with a nocal back then (about 1984 ish). There was then a fear that the 
<br />
indoor &quot;experts&quot; would ruin the Nocal class so then a weight minimum was 
<br />
added, some places flew 5gram and others flew 7 gram. USIC came out to 
<br />
6.2 as it was double a pennyplane weight. What then happened was to get 
<br />
the max flight times people looked for lower aspect ratio models to 
<br />
build. My dad and I flew Cassutt racers and Loucka built a Hosler Fury. 
<br />
The two models were pretty evenly matched at most sites but at USIC the 
<br />
Hosler could get about 10-20 seconds more consistently. I think my dads 
<br />
highest Cassut time was 7:52, I was about 7:20 and the Hosler could 
<br />
break 8 minutes so we both built Hoslers. So the weight equalizing rule 
<br />
really turned the event into a one design contest if you want to 
<br />
compete. Smaller models suffer from higher wing loading and simply will 
<br />
not do the time.
<br />
<br />Reducing the min weight (or removing it) actually allows for more model 
<br />
choice freedom because a large model like a Hosler Fury cannot be built 
<br />
under 5 grams with current FAC rules as Gampi tissue is now banned. 
<br />
Esaki tissue must be used and the Hosler has so much tissue that just 
<br />
the tissue weighs ~2.5  grams. So the long big models will still have to 
<br />
weigh more than a smaller model like a Lacey or Cessna Cardinal but a 
<br />
Cardinal has much less wing area and even at the light overall weight 
<br />
the smaller wing makes the flight times close. At the Kent indoor 
<br />
contest this year my Cardinal which is about 2 grams will do about 6 
<br />
minutes and the 6.2 gram Hoser Fury will do about 6 minutes as well in 
<br />
the same site. My dad built a Lacey this year and his  is about 3.2 
<br />
grams and does about 6 minutes as well.  So we are all doing about the 
<br />
same flight time but my Cardinal has the smallest wing and lightest 
<br />
weight, the Lacey is a little heavier but a bigger wing, and the Hosler 
<br />
is the biggest wing but also the heaviest but the wing loadings are all 
<br />
fairly close so all three can compete together with vast model types and 
<br />
weight differences.
<br />
<br />I still have my no-cal tips on the web if anyone is interested.
