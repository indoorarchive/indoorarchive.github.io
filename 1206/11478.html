<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Maybe the event should simply be dropped from indoor competition.
</em><br />
<br />So if you can't compete with the rest then delete the event? Interesting 
<br />
thinking. I have seen indoor golden age models do 4+ minutes at the 
<br />
Buffalo Bills field house by a well know Canadian FAC modeler in a 
<br />
flyoff, so should that event be banned from indoor as well? How about 
<br />
indoor dime scale models that fly 3+ minutes. Do you propose min weights 
<br />
on indoor peanut scale, dimes scale etc? How about banning 3+ minute 
<br />
indoor Phantom Flashes? So if you want to ban the event why not just ban 
<br />
all FAC events for indoor and add more time for indoor duration events.
<br />
<br />I understand the FAC rules are really meant for outdoor models but it is 
<br />
naive to think that if the same event is flown indoors that special 
<br />
models would not be made and special building techniques will not be 
<br />
adapted by the people who will be flying the event, and those people ARE 
<br />
indoor duration modelers. The reality is that the people who fly indoor 
<br />
Nocal are those who are already going to the indoor contest and are 
<br />
looking for another event to fly.
<br />
<br />Indoor duration models are different from outdoor duration models so an 
<br />
indoor Nocal is built different from an outdoor nocal just like F1D is 
<br />
built different from F1B. What I see at many indoor meets is that those 
<br />
flying the FAC events bring their outdoor models inside, and that is 
<br />
their choice. So if that is all the effort they wish to put into the 
<br />
event then so be it.  But then they risk loosing to a model built 
<br />
specifically for indoor flying.  How many people can build a 5 gram 
<br />
peanut scale Spitfire or Mustang? Jack McGillvray could do just about 3 
<br />
minutes indoor with that model in WWII combat and won just about every 
<br />
time I saw him fly it. Why did no one say Jack was ruining the event? 
<br />
Jack had the first Cessnal Cardinal Nocal and cleaned out clocks at a 
<br />
meet in Detroit with 7+ minute flights in Nocal? Why was it OK for Jack 
<br />
to do all this stuff? I was under the impression Jack was highly 
<br />
regarded in the FAC, seems to be a double standard here.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As for grossly fudging outlines, that’s a disgrace. I saw a Lacy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No-Cal built by a well-known indoor flier, now deceased, allowed to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fly at West Baden years ago sporting a motor stick that protruded 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; three or four inches beyond the model’s nose! Ridiculous!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
This issue was addressed and is not allowed in the current Nocal rules.
