This thread interests me a lot since i've been using PPP almost
<br />
exclusively over the past few years. After i read the posts i decided to
<br />
test it out myself. I too was surprised. I got 133 mg / 100 sq in +/- 3
<br />
mg or 2.06g/m^2. I actually used a piece that was close to 100 sq in
<br />
(8.25&quot;x12.125&quot;)so i would say it's accurate.  This makes me wonder how
<br />
many people including myself could of been fooled about this for so
<br />
long?
<br />
<br />Leo, has Roy White gotten back to you yet?

<br />But there was a problem. One of the girls wanted to build a LPP plane.
<br />
She
<br />
noticed the weight of the completed plane was a bit higher than she had
<br />
calculated from weighing the wood parts and using the published weights
<br />
for the
<br />
PPP film. It turns out that the PPP film she used weighed over twice
<br />
(2.2 grams
<br />
per meter squared) what she expected. We checked the other rolls by
<br />
weighing
<br />
some and got the same results for all. The PPP film was no lighter than
<br />
the 1.4
<br />
micron Ultrafilm that Ray Harlan sells and nearly twice as heavy as the
<br />
super
<br />
Ultrafilm we weighed.
<br />
<br />Since I had planned to buy some PPP film for my own LPP's, I emailed Roy
<br />
White
<br />
about this. I have yet to hear back from him. I ended up using Tim G's
<br />
Tru-lite and Ray's super Ultrafilm on my planes.

I weighed some OS film that was going on F1L parts today. The weight was
55mg/100si which seems to be usual for the last couple of rolls I've
had. My last roll of PPP - bought several years ago - was only a little
more than that.
--
It was 2.11 grams per meter squared. It will be OK for LPP, but too
heavy
for F1M. I feel regret at loosing an inexpensive and best film for F1M.
Good flying, Aki, we have a F1L and F1M contest at a 18m ceiling gym on
Friday
--
I think it would be a good move for purveyors of film to provide more
accurate weight estimates for what they are selling.
