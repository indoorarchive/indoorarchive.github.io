<br />
Since the latest flurry of postings related to modulus of elasticity 
<br />
and ways to measure it, I've been building up the motivation to go 
<br />
through my hord of wood and try the Hunt/Slusarczk program again. 
<br />
Tonight, after several days of visually sorting my 4#-5# hobby shop 
<br />
wood for flaws (checks mostly), and bend testing samples from the 
<br />
better sheets I ran the test on ten sheets that seemed to have promise. 
<br />
<br />The program translates M of E to a numeric range averaged around 100. I 
<br />
don't have the math brain to convert this number back to M of E, so I 
<br />
live with 60 to 155 SC's. When I first used the program several years 
<br />
ago I tested full 36&quot;x3+&quot; sheets. The first to lean over the good side 
<br />
of 100 was my 101st sheet. It was then quartered and further sampled. 
<br />
Since the first decent board, finding stiffer material has been easier. 
<br />
I've always felt the average sheet was on the high side of elasticity 
<br />
in this program. Then I compared my own tests of Tru-weight balsa and 
<br />
found my measurements were 10 to 20-percent lower than the stamp range 
<br />
(they were in the next lower group). I think I was recording the 
<br />
fatigue side of the buckle at the time. 
<br />
<br />The samples were strips from each side of a full sheet then cut in half 
<br />
for a sample of each quarter sheet. A full sheet test has no connection 
<br />
to good SC. It only says there is probably a lot of density variation.
<br />
<br />Tonight I probably adulterated my testing process by catching numbers 
<br />
where the fall-off began to slow down rather than at the bottom portion 
<br />
of the readings. I also averaged the readings of the two bends in each 
<br />
sample. I think the higher reading is a better representation, since 
<br />
the batch of possible spars will be final tested by cantilever beam 
<br />
(deflection gauge). 
<br />
<br />Anyway, the SC test is very tedious and I've never stopped trying to 
<br />
figure out a quicker method to weed out culls (under 100 SC). I think 
<br />
I'm getting closer. The two or three sheets under 100 were tested for 
<br />
reasons other than potential - they looked nice, felt nice, sounded 
<br />
good, and/or represented a group of adjoining mill cuts. 
<br />
<br />What I didn't expect was the variability of density and stiffness 
<br />
within individual sheets. One that was thin enough to see through was 
<br />
uniform in color but ranged from 3.4# to 5.5# A couple sheets had good 
<br />
numbers on one side and junk (70's, but great for A6) on the other. The 
<br />
rest were pretty consistent in stiffness. I wanted to say that b-grain 
<br />
was usually better than parallel grain, but some of the higher numbers 
<br />
were in A and C grain faces. However, good b-grain had good torsion 
<br />
resistance and I think I found a sleeper for EZB's, finally.
<br />
<br />After going through the stock a couple things are glaringly apparent. 
<br />
Only two of the 10 boards were purchased more recently than 2003, and 
<br />
the percentage of wood purchased after that date represents 2/3 of the 
<br />
total. I started buying wood in late 2001. There is far more density 
<br />
striping in more recent wood, also. My assumption is that most balsa in 
<br />
the US is grown in Central America. 
<br />
<br />That's it for now.
