<br />
For the past three weeks, a group of 8 modelers joined together in a
<br />
dedicated Yahoo group to discuss A6 rules.  This was announced on
<br />
Indoor_Construction Yahoo Group and everyone interested was invited.
<br />
<br />There are at least 4 sets of A-6 rules out there, which at times
<br />
compete with each other, sometimes confusing those who want to build
<br />
A6, and they have to ask, &quot;Whose rules, and where are they?&quot;  It was
<br />
the hope of the group to decide what rule set is already the most
<br />
common and accepted, and to clarify any obvious problems.  The group
<br />
contained a few of the more successful A6 flyers, who knew the
<br />
problems in the context of local and national contests. We present
<br />
here the results, which will also be posted in Files section of
<br />
Indoor_Construction, called &quot;A-6 National Rules.&quot;  It is our hope
<br />
that this effort will be accepted by general acclamation.
<br />
Obviously, 8 modelers would not have the authority to change
<br />
anything.  On the other hand, it appears no real A-6 authority even
<br />
exists, except individual CDs or perhaps clubs.  Therefore, no rule
<br />
below changes anything the about model's description, at least as
<br />
flown at USIC and Midwest Champs.  It is hoped that everyone
<br />
concerned will accept the  one &quot;new&quot; thing, and that is for
<br />
contestant to provide the CD with a drawing of wing area
<br />
calculations, purely for the convenience and accuracy of model
<br />
processing at contests.  These rules will also be archived on at
<br />
least two other websites, which fortunately also had moderator's
<br />
representation within the A6 group: IndoorNews.com and Small Flying
<br />
Arts.   The group was Jerry Combs, Gary Hodson, Chris Borland, Andy
<br />
Ondrej, Jeff Hood, Tom Sova, and Mark Bennett.
<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
A6 Rules Group.
<br />
