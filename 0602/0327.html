Here is my method.
<br />
<br />I take my form, I use brass tubing for motorsticks and aluminum rod for 
<br />
booms, and lay it in front of me. I cut a piece of tissue about 2&quot; 
<br />
longer than the balsa blank and about 4-5 times wider than the blank. I 
<br />
then lay the one edge of the tissue on top of the rod about at midpoint. 
<br />
I then take a fine soft brush (like used for apply water to microfilm) 
<br />
and stick the tip in my mouth to get it wet with a little saliva. I then 
<br />
dab it along the tissue to stick it to the form. I never have good luck 
<br />
using water for this part. In any case, I then carefully lift it up and 
<br />
turn it over and then do one complete roll then about an additional 1 /4 
<br />
-1/2 roll of the dry tissue around the form. Make sure it is tightly 
<br />
wrapped. It is very much like making a tissue tube, but instead of 
<br />
gluing it to the rod, I use a brush with a little bit if saliva and it 
<br />
will hold it long enough to let you do this first roll. I then place a 
<br />
weight on the rod as if you let it go it will try to unroll itself. I 
<br />
then take my blank to be rolled and run it under the faucet with fairly 
<br />
hot water. I run the sheet back and forth a few times. Then I hold it up 
<br />
by one end in my left hand, and using my index and middle finger (of the 
<br />
right hand) on either side of the sheet, 'squeeze' the excess water off 
<br />
with a pulling down motion The squeeze is made by placing the sheet of 
<br />
wood between your two fingers like if you were making a 'V' with your 
<br />
two fingers, and you clamp the wood between them. By pulling down you 
<br />
put the wood in tension, and the excess water will get squeezed out from 
<br />
your two fingers. (Like and old fashioned washing machine with the 
<br />
ringer rollers). When you do this you will find that there will be small 
<br />
balsa 'flakes'/dust mixed in with this water. I rewet the sheet with 
<br />
water and repeat this two or three times. Generally by the third time 
<br />
the excess water is clean.  I have thought that these extra loose balsa 
<br />
fibers were the reason for sticking to the tissue. as I felt they would 
<br />
act like a weak 'paste' between the sheet and the tissue, but that is my 
<br />
voodoo reason behind it.  Then I take the sheet and butt the edge of the 
<br />
blank  into the  area where the tissue and rod meet.  I then roll it 
<br />
quickly. If you leave the sheet sit for more than a few minutes it dries 
<br />
out pretty quick as you have squeezed off all excess water so pay 
<br />
attention it is still wet before you roll. Once the sheet is rolled on 
<br />
the rod, I keep rolling until the tissue is used. This is usually 1 to 2 
<br />
more rolls past the end of the wood blank. I the place masking tape in 
<br />
the middle, then each end, then in between again, so in 5 places.  I 
<br />
bake at 200F for about 20-25 minutes, then take then out and let them 
<br />
sit until they are cool to the touch. I then unwrap. I always unwrap 
<br />
after they just cooled off. I do not let them sit overnight or for days 
<br />
as I had the masking tape adhesive leech through the tissue to the wood, 
<br />
and the balsa stuck in only the places the tape was applied.
<br />
<br />That is they way I have rolled booms and bodies for 15-20 years. 
<br />
Individual results may vary.
<br />
<br />PS: one other thing I forgot to mention, as I used brass rods a lot they 
<br />
tend to tarnish. Before I use them, I always sand with 400 or 600 grit 
<br />
sandpaper to shine them up and then clean off with acetone.
