I think this has some ramifications for indoor flying.
<br />
<br />Question
<br />
<br />Why do rubber bands contract when heated instead of expanding?
<br />
<br />Asked by: Trenton Vogt
<br />
<br />Answer
<br />
<br />Rubber band entropyRubber bands are unusual because they are made from
<br />
loosely-packed chains of atoms. These long molecules behave in a
<br />
special way because of a property in physics that we call Entropy.
<br />
<br />Entropy is a way of measuring the amount of 'disorder' in a system. If
<br />
all the chains are neatly lined up in rows, we say that the entropy is
<br />
very low. If they are all tangled up in a mess, we say that the
<br />
entropy is high. We even have ways of calculating actual numbers for
<br />
the entropy. But all we need to know here is, the messier the system,
<br />
the higher the entropy.
<br />
<br />Now here's an experiment you can do in your head. Imagine you have
<br />
lots of long pieces of string, screwed up into a ball. They're not
<br />
rolled up neatly, or coiled... just screwed up like random scribbles
<br />
on a piece of paper. It's quite a mess, and the entropy is quite high.
<br />
Now imagine that you grab hold of the two sides of this mess, and
<br />
start to pull them apart. Something quite neat will happen... Even
<br />
though they'll still be tangled up, you'll see that in the middle they
<br />
all line up in straight lines pointing from your left hand to your
<br />
right hand. You've created order out of a mess, and you've reduced the
<br />
entropy in the system.
<br />
<br />This is exactly what happens inside a rubber band when you stretch it.
<br />
The messy tangles line up a bit, and the entropy goes down. Now, in
<br />
physics, when the entropy goes down, the system gives out heat, and
<br />
when the entropy goes up, the system takes in heat from around it.
<br />
(There is a complicated way of finding the equations for this, but we
<br />
don't need to bother with that here.) But you can actually feel this
<br />
for yourself with a thick rubber band and your upper lip, which is
<br />
very sensitive to changes in temperature. If you suddenly stretch the
<br />
rubber band and immediately press it against your upper lip, you'll
<br />
feel that it's got hot - heat energy has been given out. More
<br />
impressive is when you let the rubber band back to its normal length -
<br />
you'll feel the rubber band go amazingly cool against your skin, as it
<br />
sucks up heat from you. Try it a few times, as the band gives out heat
<br />
when you stretch it, and sucks it back in again when you let it back
<br />
again.
<br />
<br />The smart thing is that it works both ways... you can push and pull
<br />
the rubber band, and feel the heat coming and going, or you can push
<br />
and pull heat into the rubber band, by heating it up and cooling it
<br />
down, and the rubber band will respond!
<br />
<br />You just noticed that when you let the rubber band contract, it sucks
<br />
heat away from the environment. But what about your question: What
<br />
happens if the rubber band is already stretched and you heat it up?
<br />
You already felt that heat disappears into the rubber band when it
<br />
contracts. So if we actually put some heat into the rubber band, by
<br />
heating it up, we can force it to contract all by itself! By heating
<br />
it up, we increase the entropy. The molecules get twisted and tangled
<br />
tighter together, just the opposite of what happened with that tangle
<br />
of string that we imagined pulling apart.
<br />
<br />So by heating the rubber band up, we increase the entropy - the amount
<br />
of disorder among its molecules - and we make it pull itself tighter
<br />
together. That's why a rubber band contracts when you heat it up.
