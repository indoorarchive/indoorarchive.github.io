<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Cat. 2 ceiling is 37'. It sounds like most of the numbers for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weights I've seen on this list are for sites of slightly over Cat. 1 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; max. Or, are you guys pushing the minimum weight and not reaching full 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; height?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hello Bruce
<br />
<br />Just got home from flying at the Emory gym, actually. The ceiling is
<br />
35' clear. Air was on, so getting times is impossible. Bill and I were
<br />
there to see how our models launch in a bit higher ceiling. I was
<br />
flying my big HLG and my 1.4g standard. Both models had about .4g of
<br />
ballast added for the session. I was getting a 1.8g (total) Cat I
<br />
standard pretty close to the rafters. Flaps were buzzing, but I was
<br />
launching it on twice the rubber I use for Cat I. Bill was getting a
<br />
1.5ish gram standard to the roof without too much trouble. 
<br />
<br />There are other things besides weight that affect penetration. My
<br />
models always climb higher when they're new. As the leading edges and
<br />
tips get chewed up, everything suffers. The curvature of the bottom of
<br />
the wing, right up near the leading edge, is really critical for the
<br />
speed range. The leading edge curvature (sharp!) is another thing.
<br />
&quot;Flappiness&quot; of the flaps as well. Too stiff and they don't get up out
<br />
of the way. Too weak and they start buzzing. Neither of these is good
<br />
for the climb. 
<br />
<br />I always try to defy some law of the universe, by building
<br />
rediculously light, yet extremely strong gliders. I push the minimum
<br />
weight as far as I can, and then launch it as hard as I can. You can
<br />
get 1.4g of wood up 30' but you've gotta have a model that you can
<br />
really put some power on. Things start getting hairy though, as boom
<br />
flex and flap buzz threaten to make the model explode. If your boom
<br />
flexes too much, the stab might fold, and the model will tumble and
<br />
come apart in the air around your head. The flaps buzzing really
<br />
fatigues the flap wood, shortening the lifespan of the model and
<br />
screwing up the flex characteristics. 
<br />
<br />Seeing as how you've got so many wings and fuses, why not make them
<br />
interchangeable? Some combination has to work better than the rest. 
<br />
<br />Good luck, enough babbling from me. 
<br />
