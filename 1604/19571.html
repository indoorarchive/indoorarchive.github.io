There has been a lot of discussion of this event as of late and it seems to be gaining interest as a beginner event.  With that in mind, could someone please tell me exactly how this event benefits new indoor fliers?  From the dimensions it appears as though a SO plane and LPP had a baby and we call it P18.  It has a larger wing than the SO event, but a bit smaller than LPP.  It weighs a touch more than SO, and more than double that of LPP.  So it is highly loaded, and will fly fast.  Will this lead to damage to a model after a collision with a wall, ceiling, or floor?  Is that what we want for our new fliers?  The plastic prop is easy on the surface, but does not teach prop construction, an essential skill of almost any of the other AMA/FAI events.  So what exactly is the purpose of P18?
<br />
<br />From where I am sitting, the only benefit I see is that experienced indoor fliers might not want to build one, so it takes those individuals out of the competition.  This gives newer fliers a chance to win an event, but at the same rate, I learn far more getting my butt kicked by experienced competitors rather than beating people with levels of experience similar to my own.
<br />
<br />Again, my .$02.  Personally, I haven't much interest in this event and it is very doubtful I will fly it, so I don't really care one way or another.  And please don't take my questions and criticism to be negative.  They are not.  I just want to know how P18 can honestly benefit indoor flying and what void it fills.  If that can be explained succinctly and logically, I would have no problems supporting the event for adoption as an official AMA event.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Right now I would agree with Josh that adding it as an unofficial event doesn't make much sense because it complicates the process of adjusting the rules.  I'm building one now, and I plan to fly it tomorrow so I'll have firsthand knowledge of the event in case it comes up for a vote again.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I still fail to see the benefit of having P-18 be an official &quot;unofficial&quot; event. What benefit is there to the beginner to have it be AMA recognized? It gets held at the contest either way, and the rules are *much* easier to edit as needed for availability or what have you. Those edits are going to happen either way in practice, but now, there's an official set of rules to confuse beginners with yet further.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If this absolutely has to be an official event, the prop size thing needs to be settled *now*. You don't vote in favor of legislation (or rules proposals) that still need fixing and for which support for the fix has not been consolidated.
