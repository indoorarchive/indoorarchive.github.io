Evan,     University of Michigan is worth serious consideration.  U of M was the first university in the USA to create an aerospace engineering program and is celebrating its 100 year anniversary this year.  They are currently ranked as the #2 (behind only MIT) undergraduate aerospace engineering program by US News &amp; World Report.  Famous alumni include Clarence &quot;Kelly&quot; Johnson and five astronauts that have orbited the earth (three of whom also visited the moon) and many other aerospace engineers of note.  I attended U of M for three years before transferring to a competing university a little north of Ann Arbor and can vouch for how serious they are about a rigorous education.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the experiences you will thoroughly enjoy and that you can find at University of Michigan and at many similar institutions will be the amazing fellow students you will study with.  My U of M roommate was the 1974 runner-up for the LeRoy Apker Award and I am still telling stories about him 40 years later.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are many good colleges and universities and many factors to consider.  I have a niece in the Purdue Mechanical Engineering program and her stories of rewarding accomplishment and enormous pressure and competition are amazing and, I believe typical, of a program like this at a top university.  I also have a nephew in the U of M Mechanical engineering program and his experience has also been quite rewarding and challenging.  Work very hard on your advanced math concepts in High School if you intend to study at one of these top college engineering programs.  Also, be aware that competition from international students is pretty intense to get into these programs and while you are in them too.
