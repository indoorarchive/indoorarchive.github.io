I'm all for the drone delivery application. My USPS postman can't really
<br />
climb stairs so if he makes a delivery attempt he tosses my packages onto
<br />
my second-story deck.
<br />
<br />I think a growing area in UAV development will be solar powered drones that
<br />
act as near earth satellites.
<br />
<br />More on topic,
<br />
<br />I entered college with the intent of being an AE student in 2007. I'm now a
<br />
math specialist at school for students with language based learning
<br />
differences. The changes from my goals when I entered college in 2007 to
<br />
early in my career now were due to a series of unforeseen opportunities. An
<br />
actuarial firm offered me a scholarship during my first year in college
<br />
that amounted to tuition plus 50% of my room and board. I took it after I
<br />
realized that the difference between and applied math a degree and
<br />
engineering degree were only a few classes apart. When it came time to make
<br />
a decision about which degree I would graduate with, I decided the math
<br />
degree opened more doors for me. I ended up going strait into graduate
<br />
school and my undergraduate university. I was recruited for my first job by
<br />
an alumni, and that ultimately lead to my helping to create an define my
<br />
current job. I'm very happy with where I landed even though it has very
<br />
little resemblance to what set out to do.
<br />
<br />I would suggest choosing a college that has a variety of good programs and
<br />
broad general education requirements. Once out of school its invaluable to
<br />
know competent people in other fields. Unless you are going into a field
<br />
that requires licensure, what you actually major in isn't as important as
<br />
the classes you take and the extracurricular experiences you have. For
<br />
careers that require licensure, its important to choose a program in the
<br />
state that you want to practice and which has a good track record for
<br />
supporting its graduates when they go through the licensure process.
<br />
<br />All that is to say, don't think that your first step has to be your last
<br />
step. Whether you follow your current plans or make changes along the way
<br />
the critical thinking skills that make you and excellent indoor skills will
<br />
serve you well throughout your life.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
<br />Nick
