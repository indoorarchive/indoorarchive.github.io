Sounds like a lot of us did the same thing. I went to The Ohio State 
<br />
University for Aeronautical Engineering convinced I would be nothing 
<br />
other than an Aero Engineer. When it came time to officially declare my 
<br />
major after two years I decided to go Mechanical Engineering. At the 
<br />
time students at the top of the Aero class who were graduating were 
<br />
having tough times finding jobs and the aero industry was typically 
<br />
paying 10% less for engineers compared to other industries. I felt a 
<br />
BSME gave me the best option post graduation to find employment. I was 
<br />
able to tailor my program to have electives in Aero (with instructor 
<br />
permission) and took additional classes in fluid dynamics and 
<br />
mathematics. I was glad I went the BSME route, I have been working at 
<br />
the same company now for 20 years. It is not aeronautics but I still 
<br />
work with fluids. I am now a Senior Design Engineer and I design custom 
<br />
hydraulic valves and fuel system valves. So keeping my options open 
<br />
worked well for me. One person I went to college with who stayed in the 
<br />
Aero industry has changed jobs multiple times and moved around the 
<br />
country several times to stay employed. Not sure if that is the norm 
<br />
these days in Aero or not. Even so, engineering is great profession to 
<br />
be in. It is very rewarding and as a bonus salary compensation has been 
<br />
on the rise due to lack of engineering graduates :-)
