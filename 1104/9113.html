From: Charles Markos 
<br />
The IL SO tournament was held yesterday, April 16, at the U of IL
<br />
campus.  Flight events were in the 95-foot armory.  Two trial events
<br />
were featured:  Capacitor-powered Wright Stuff and Indoor Towline
<br />
Glider.  Oh yeah...the official helicopter event was also flown.  We
<br />
were a busy crew of supervisors to get it all in from 8 am until 3:15
<br />
pm.
<br />
<br />In the WS-cap event, the best flights in both Div-B (middle school)
<br />
and Div-C (high school) were well over 2 minutes.  None of the teams
<br />
used geared motors.  Three of the 2-minute flights carried a penny
<br />
ballast to bring their ready-to-fly weights over 13 grams.  One Div-B
<br />
airplane resembling my &quot;Double Whammy&quot; design weighed exactly 12 grams
<br />
(no ballast) and was the only airplane to fly up to and hit the
<br />
ceiling truss.   After the hit, it recovered nicely and kept flying
<br />
unlike the experience some of us have had with airplanes constructed
<br />
to minimum weight.  The motor was attached to a pylon added behind the
<br />
wing TE.  A 65 mm &quot;tri-turbofan&quot; prop from Plantraco was used.  The
<br />
other high-performing airplanes were derivatives of the design I
<br />
developed as prototype (you all should have seen the plans) and used
<br />
the 55? mm Plantraco propeller.  One had the motor on a separate pylon
<br />
behind the wing.  Maximum altitude was a safe 60 feet.   It was quite
<br />
interesting to observe the two best Div-C teams battle it out in
<br />
practice flights to push each other to do just a little bit better.
<br />
<br />In towlline glider, the winning airplanes weighed about 5 grams and
<br />
their best flights in practice were in excess of 60 seconds.  However,
<br />
official flights were plagued by towing mistakes.  The phenomenon of
<br />
top teams pushing each other was obvious in practice.  Teams that were
<br />
happy with 25-seconds in their school gyms watched rivals slowly
<br />
improve as they learned how to reach altitudes in excess of 50 ft as
<br />
an informal challange developed to get the competitive juices flowing.
<br />
<br />In both trial events it was evident that the kids really enjoyed the
<br />
testing and flying of their ariplanes.  I was able to help some during
<br />
the Friday night practice session, but on Saturday, they were on their
<br />
own to come up with solutions to any problems that came up.  Very
<br />
gratifying.
<br />
<br />We had about 20 entrants each in the two capacitor events divisions
<br />
and the same in towline glider, although there were a number of
<br />
no-shows.
<br />
<br />Some of the cap airplanes had heavy RC motors and were hopeless, of
<br />
course. Some other hopeless models did not have supercapacitors or
<br />
were so poorly constructed that I felt bad for the kids.  As usual, it
<br />
was quite obvious that some teams paid very little attention to the
<br />
availiable information, much less the rules for the
<br />
event...e.g..showing up with a 6-volt lantern battery for a charger.
<br />
One team found some &quot;high energy&quot; photo AA cells that were labelled
<br />
&quot;Nickle oxide hydroxide&quot; and were getting very good practice flights.
<br />
They were exchanged for AA alkaline cells at check-in.  Comparison of
<br />
the alkaline vs the Nickle oxide cells showed a marked increase in
<br />
voltage for the latter.
<br />
<br />Best flights in Helicopter were just over 2 minutes also.
