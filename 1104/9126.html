I can see now why J. Kagan switched to STD, CLG.

<br />
<br />Â  
<br />
The extended after hours session was well worth the time and money. At one 
<br />
point, there were four F1Ds in the air (Kagan, Bennett, two of the Tysons). Four 
<br />
lone F1Ds *floating* in the KSU field house in hushed silence -- I loved the 
<br />
atmosphere.
<br />
<br />I'll report some of the things I observed. Later, I'll post a few videos I took. 
<br />
Not many were taken, as I was always busy trimming and flying my models.
<br />
<br />Mark Bennett deserves grand kudos for setting a new Cat II F1D record. This 
<br />
happened late into the night, after Mark had destroyed his main F1D wing on a 
<br />
previous flight when the steering balloon burst during a steer. He tried a 
<br />
couple of back-up wings, found one that he liked, and was able to muster the 
<br />
patience and nerves to get a new model flying to set the record. After a quick 
<br />
bite to eat where we grilled him about his record flight, he was on the road 
<br />
back to Omaha. Well done, Mark.
<br />
<br />John Kagan was also hunting to break his own Cat II F1D record. His model flew 
<br />
beautifully. On one flight where he was near the record, his model suffered an 
<br />
unexpected tail slide at 30'. For this beginner, it was great to witness the 
<br />
great flying put on by John and Mark. Don't be surprised if the record is broken 
<br />
again soon by one of these gents. Buy your tickets now for Kent 2012, if not 
<br />
just to witness the great F1D flying.
<br />
<br />The air during the contest wasn't very good, especially for the guys flying the 
<br />
ultra light EZBs. Jim Richmond came in first, and I was a not-too-distant 
<br />
second. Jim's time was about 19:30 and mine was 18:50. Later in the evening when 
<br />
the air was a little better, I was able to clock a 20:45 flight. Jim had put 
<br />
away his EZB by then, so we didn't see his usual 23+ flights.
<br />
<br />Leo Pilachowski flew a very odd looking but great performing F1L. It has no wing 
<br />
dihedral and only vertical wing plates. It flew very slowly with slow prop RPM. 
<br />
Leo took first place in F1L.
<br />
<br />It was great to see the three Tysons all flying F1Ds.
<br />
<br />John Kagan's CLG was incredible. I wish someone has a video of it flying. He 
<br />
gets a really high launch and a really slow glide. I guess that's how you set a 
<br />
new CLG record.
<br />
<br />Some of you may have heard that I came close to breaking the F1L record. Well, I 
<br />
didn't break it. I had a great flight of 16:23, which betters the current record 
<br />
of 16:06. But when we processed the model after the flight, it weighed only 
<br />
1.17g. (F1L has a minimum weight requirement of 1.2g.) It was a costly rookie 
<br />
mistake (yet another one) that hopefully never happens again. Still, it was a 
<br />
great flight -- what can I say!
<br />
<br />Kent was a really fun contest. It seemed like we had plenty of time to fly, and 
<br />
we did not need to hurry. The KSU fieldhouse is a great site to fly in, although 
<br />
it was not easy to judge the model's climb. And the hanging lights and the beam 
<br />
will get you if you fly too aggressively.
