<br /><br />It is easy to get heavy for a few reasons.
<br />
<br />1) to strong a solution
<br />
2) too much applied
<br />
<br />I found that for different films a different solution had to be used. 
<br />
For heavier films like polymicro (0.9 micro) I needed a stronger 
<br />
solution than for Y2K. What I would do is take one of those small jars 
<br />
that are about 1&quot; in diameter and about  1.5&quot; tall (~3/4oz or so) then 
<br />
spray 3M77 in the bottle for about 3-4 seconds. Then fill to about 3/4 
<br />
full with TCE then shake it vigorously. I would then take a piece of 
<br />
1/16&quot; sq wood about 3&quot; long and lay it on the film. Then take a brush 
<br />
and apply the solution and let it dry for at least 30 minutes. Then pull 
<br />
on the piece of 1/16 to see how much force to pull it from the film. If 
<br />
it comes off easy then add a quick squirt of 3M77 and try again. Too 
<br />
strong add more solvent. Typically I would keep thinning until it became 
<br />
too weak then add in one quick squirt of 3M to bring it back up. For Y2K 
<br />
the solution was very thin like 10:1 or maybe even more. For heavier 
<br />
films I had to make a stronger solution like say 7:1. I recall that the 
<br />
stronger solution has a slight  milky haze and the thinner solution for 
<br />
Y2K looked essentially like pure solvent. In either case, if you rub the 
<br />
soluton between your fingers you will not feel any tackiness.
<br />
<br />Where the weight really comes in is if you use a strong solution when it 
<br />
is not needed combined with over application. All that is needed is to 
<br />
apply a small drop from the end of a brush to the outside of the outline 
<br />
then let it wick a few seconds then apply another drop and so on. It is 
<br />
very much like how applying microfilm with water was/is done. If one 
<br />
drop wicks 1.5 inches in each direction then the next drop is applied 3&quot; 
<br />
away. Then tendency is to apply the drops too close to each other or 
<br />
worse continuously along the outline. The excess glue just gets soaked 
<br />
up into the wood. You are better off to apply the drops farther apart 
<br />
then go back and fill in the missing areas. I cover wings upside down 
<br />
(with the film on a frame) so after I have gone around the outline with 
<br />
the solution, I flip the frame over and look to see if some spots are 
<br />
missed. You can see where the film is attached to the wood or not pretty 
<br />
easily if you look at an angle with good lighting. Once I am happy with 
<br />
everything, I let it dry for an hour or so before messing with it.
<br />
