Bill, what a great way to cover an EZB! The solution pulls the mylar to the
<br />
outline, It's better than sliced bread!

If you're unsure about any of it just glue 4 sticks together and give it a
<br />
try. Make sure the solution is 10:1 or more so it will wick. Spraying is
<br />
easier for some stuff but some people have problems with spraying on really
<br />
light structurse like EZB. Kang uses spraying on 300mg EZB's! the problem
<br />
with spraying is that you only get one shot at getting it right.

Normally the first application of the solution will anchor the outline. If
<br />
you're worried about it you can dab a little of the solution in a couple of
<br />
spots around the perimeter. The outline shouldn't change shape during the
<br />
process.

Bill, Thanks for the quick reply.  What holds the outline in place while
<br />
your applying the solution? And , getting the outline &quot;wet&quot; does it change
<br />
shape?

I like to let it sit for at least an hour before I start cutting the film.
<br />
Overnight is even better. It's one of those things where it's real painful
<br />
if you mess up.

Bill, for some reason the Indoor Construction site is not working &amp; I have a
<br />
question on your version. When u apply the &quot;solution&quot; to the outline that is
<br />
setting on top of the mylar how long does it take to cure or dry?
<br />
Thanks
<br />

Covering with Mylar is very easy. There are a lot of different ways to do it
<br />
&nbsp;The video you saw is my version of the technique described by F1Diddler in
<br />
the files section of this group.

<br />
This is one of the toughest parts of indoor, covering. I was at a web site
<br />
where someone was covering with mylar &amp; was using 3M77 in a &quot;little&quot; plastic
<br />
container mixing it with a solvent and putting it on a stab. with a brush,
<br />
then it was over! It said this process was on Indoor Construction but I
<br />
cannot find it. These guys with the F1Ds that look like they were covered
<br />
with moulded Mylar must be able to leap tall buildings in a single bound!
<br />
Help.....please.
