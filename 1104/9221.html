Huston, Thanks for the info. Here's what happened! My CD Archive Collection 
<br />
62-'03 of Indoor News &amp; Views all of a sudden told me my time had expired! &amp;
<br />
I couldn't use it. I contacted Tim Goldstien, he said &quot;SORRY&quot; there was
<br />
nothing he could do to help me. I changed the computer date to 2009 &amp;
<br />
everything works great!!  I should correct it when Emailing &amp; change it back
<br />
when I use the CD. I didn't know my emails were dated 2009, thanks.

Normally the first application of the solution will anchor the outline. If
<br />
you're worried about it you can dab a little of the solution in a couple of
<br />
spots around the perimeter. The outline shouldn't change shape during the
<br />
process.

Bill, Thanks for the quick reply.  What holds the outline in place while
<br />
your applying the solution? And , getting the outline &quot;wet&quot; does it change
<br />
shape?

I like to let it sit for at least an hour before I start cutting the film.
<br />
Overnight is even better. It's one of those things where it's real painful
<br />
if you mess up.

Bill, for some reason the Indoor Construction site is not working &amp; I have a
<br />
question on your version. When u apply the &quot;solution&quot; to the outline that is
<br />
setting on top of the mylar how long does it take to cure or dry?
<br />
Thanks
<br />

Covering with Mylar is very easy. There are a lot of different ways to do it
<br />
&nbsp;The video you saw is my version of the technique described by F1Diddler in
<br />
the files section of this group.

<br />
This is one of the toughest parts of indoor, covering. I was at a web site
<br />
where someone was covering with mylar &amp; was using 3M77 in a &quot;little&quot; plastic
<br />
container mixing it with a solvent and putting it on a stab. with a brush,
<br />
then it was over! It said this process was on Indoor Construction but I
<br />
cannot find it. These guys with the F1Ds that look like they were covered
<br />
with moulded Mylar must be able to leap tall buildings in a single bound!
<br />
Help.....please.
