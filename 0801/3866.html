<br />Thanks, Fred, I'll try with thinner glue next. Actually those tubes that I
<br />
did seem to be closer to 50 than 100mg per pair...
<br />
<br />I uploaded a couple of pics of my latest attempt to build a F1M VP hub.
<br />
The layout and functioning is rather conventional, except that I used
<br />
pultruded carbon tube (0.5mm ID 1.0mm OD) as the main body supporting the
<br />
blades. The tube is reasonable in weight, about 800mg per metre, so a 40mm
<br />
piece for the hub weights about 35mg. It is super stiff and much stronger
<br />
than balsa at the same weight.
<br />
<br />I also used the tubing as hinges. I had tried the ukrainian style before,
<br />
where a T-shaped wire goes into the tube, attaches to the blade, and then
<br />
turns down to meet actuating arm. This seemed quite flimsy to me, wit only
<br />
the vertical wires supperting towards the actuating arm to hold blades in
<br />
place. So instead I used two pieces of wire, bent 90 degrees at the end.
<br />
to go into the hub tube and act as the hinges. The outer one can be easily
<br />
seen at the end of the tube, but wire that changes the blade pitch is
<br />
another hinge. The VP hub tube has a slot underneath so that the wire hook
<br />
can go into the tube through the slot. The wire is stiff enough the handle
<br />
such a slot, even though it weakens it somewhat.
<br />
<br />The weight are reasonable, the hub with paper tubes and all is 190mg, prop
<br />
shaft wih actuating arm 90mg and the spring 30mg. AUW 320mg. I plan to try
<br />
the same setup next for F1D, hoping to get to 100mg, by using thinner
<br />
carbon tube and wire, and use 00-90 bolts instead of the M2 used in this
<br />
hub.
<br />
<br />The hub is built up with (ordinary laminating) epoxy. I drilled a hole
<br />
through the hub for the shaft, cut a length of the tube as support (inside
<br />
the  spring, the set these up on a piece of waxed piano wire, wrapped the
<br />
joint in carbon and wetted with epoxy.Once cured, I grinded all extra
<br />
stuff of. The same thing with spring pretension adjust, I waxed a steel M2
<br />
bolt, wrapped it onto the carbon tube with carbon towing, wetted and
<br />
grinded. For the pitch adjustment fork I lanimated a piece of U-shaped
<br />
carbon, cut to shape, and glued onto place with epoxy with carbon tow in
<br />
1mm pieces hacked and mixed in.
<br />
<br />I think, for a neater and lighter hubs, simple silicone molds could be
<br />
used to increase carbon to epoxy ratio and make the parts neater. One mold
<br />
to make the tube centre joint and pre-tension screw housing, another for
<br />
the pitch fork. The latter would need carbon that was T-shaped in cross
<br />
section, as flat carbon seems too fimsy, that is why I had to glue the
<br />
ugly piece of carbon sheet across the U in this prototype...
<br />
<br />I think I still have something to learn about sizing the springs. I read
<br />
that people use up to 90 degrees of pretension. Seems like with my springs
<br />
I can use only around 10 degrees, otherwise they get too strong. Maybe I
<br />
should use thinner wire?
<br />
<br />Sorry for the quality of the pics. Took them under lamp light, so color
<br />
balance was way off, and looks like I over-adjusted them to be too blue...
<br />
But then, not much color with black carbon, silver steel and white nylon
<br />
:)
