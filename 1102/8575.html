Ed,
<br />
<br />There is no secret. Rubber that is &quot;broken in&quot; or pre-stretched, has more energy 
<br />
than virgin rubber.
<br />
&nbsp;The evening before you are going to fly, loop your motor to 7 to 10 inches, and 
<br />
stretch your motor between the doorknob and the top of the door in your motel 
<br />
room, and let it sit for 5 minutes. Let it rest for 1 hour, and repeat. Let it 
<br />
rest overnight, and your motor will have much more energy. Some times the loop 
<br />
will break, and this is a good thing, because it will not break on the day of 
<br />
the meet. Make a habit of checking for cuts, splices, and delaminations, as I 
<br />
said. The 0.42&quot; inch strip is actually laminated from two sheets of 0.021&quot;, 
<br />
originally designed for golf ball windings. Some times it parts, but not often. 
<br />
Look edgewise, instead of flat-on, and you might see it.
<br />
<br />Another thing, get in the habit of winding motors until they break, the night 
<br />
before, or the week before. All the time. This is 100%. Write it down in terms 
<br />
of TPI, breaking turns per inch.
<br />
<br />Then at the meet, you can wind to 95% of these turns with SOME  confidence that 
<br />
the motor will not break. Again, a broke-in motor will  take more winds than a 
<br />
virgin motor. We use the term TPI, or turns per  inch. 100 to 110 TPI is a good 
<br />
bench mark for starting. Thus a 12 inch  loop will be good for 1200 to 1300 
<br />
turns. A broken in motor may be safe at 1400 turns. This can be the difference 
<br />
between 2nd and third place.
<br />
<br />Values of foot pounds or specific numbers are not important, pre stretching and 
<br />
preparation is.
<br />
<br />Obarski was a champ. The best. He has caught that final thermal.
<br />
<br />The idea is to prestretch it 7 to 8 times its original length, or until it gets 
<br />
real tight. Also take some with you that you did not prestretch, and you will 
<br />
see a difference. Keep it in poly bags and label them.
<br />
<br />You mention procedure. Dick and all the rest of us kept notebooks. Buy a spiral 
<br />
binder. Write down what you do. Keep a record. You can refer to it from time to 
<br />
time.
<br />
<br />Separate you rubber into so-so, good, and very good. Use the first two for 
<br />
practice and testing, the last for contests. Other modellers may sell you some 
<br />
of there good batches, as well. We are very friendly, and help each other out.
<br />
<br /><br />Carl

Hello Carl, I've just joined the forum and found this email interesting. When I 
<br />
first got into indoor it was in Tampa where I met Dick Obarski who was an ole 
<br />
timer in indoor, you may have known him or heard of him. He took me under his 
<br />
wing and became my mentor. He was in the middle of testing rubber and was going 
<br />
through the stretching ( using a scale to measure pounds of pull) as u stated. 
<br />
He would stretch a certain distance, measure , let the rubber rest  then 
<br />
re-stretch at a greater distance and measure etc. He would do this until he 
<br />
would come up with a value. However , this was so long ago I forgot his 
<br />
procedure!!!

I have done a lot of rubber testing thanks to Goldstein's prodding during my 
<br />
INAV days, testing mostLy 7 inch loops of 1/8 strip, and without exception, 
<br />
those that broke did so at the knot. These knots were un lubricated, due to the 
<br />
difficulty of tying a lubed knot. The stye of the knot did not matter ... It 
<br />
seemed that that was where all of the stress was located.
<br />
<br />I wrapped my loops for stretch testing around a nail, over which was slid a 
<br />
piece of Tygon fuel tubing. This also allowed the knot to move, in keeping with 
<br />
current FAC technology for short rubber motors in multiple-engine planes.

Here is another source for 90A durometer o-rings at a great price.
