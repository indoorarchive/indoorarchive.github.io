&nbsp;Thanks for all the suggestions so far.  It appears Ind_Const is has a useful niche apart from a regular message board.  By &quot;regular&quot; I mean those boards that do not offer complete email service for every post, to every member.  For example, on one message board Im a member of (different hobby) the only way you get member posts as emails is when you subscribe to a specific thread or topic--not all posts from entire forum.  And at some point, you are told &quot;no more emails about this thread until you visit the board.&quot;  That's probably purely to get the traffic expected by advertisers.
<br />
Right now, appears Groups.io. may have what we want.  Free, and no ads.  (Not to say that ads are a deal breaker.) Thanks Nick Ray for showing Ind_Const hasnt come close to even 1 G storage yet.  The remaining problem may be transferring files and message archives.  Yahoo doesn't seem to put everything in nice big folders to easily copy and send.  For Groups.io., it may have to be tranferred one file at a time.  Doable enough for files and photos, but not for message archives.  Could someone put me in touch with whomever saved the archives from Don S's Yahoo group, circa 2006?  Was it Jeff Hood?Thanks,Moderator

<br />We are currently using 105mb of 2gb. I would say 1gb is sufficient. 
<br />
I like having this group exist as stand alone from HPA. Its much easier for me to read email at work than it is to go visit a forum. 
<br />
All the best,

<br />&nbsp;Every member who has not already configured your Ind_Const. membership to &quot;receive email&quot; posts should do so before Oct 21, 2019.  (Log in, go to members settings.)  Otherwise, you will hear nothing from this group from Oct 21 onward.  The webpage will be there, but frozen against any new posts or uploads of any kind.  You can download individual photos, files, and messages up until December 14, 2019.  Then the webpage disappears.  Email posts continue, if the group remains Yahoo.Moderator

<br />&nbsp;According to .Groups.IO site, it's all ad free.  Three tiers of membership.  Free, $10/month, and $200/month.  The relevant (to us at least) differences in tiers seems to be storage space.  Free is 1G, $10/month gets 10 Gig.  Anyone know how to estimate the storage needed for Ind_Construction archives, photos and files?  I'm sure Yahoo knows.

Yahoo Groups is going away soon.  Where do we want to go with indoor_construction?  Is this forum something we want to keep going?  Or has it been made redundant by other forums like Hip Pocket?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />It isn't clear where or how this group can be migrated with all posts and files intact.  Apparently it isn't practical or possible to move it to Google.  Groups.io has been recommended but in order to migrate this group to Groups.io requires a paid subscription. 
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Another option might be to start a new group and just copy whatever files are still relevant to the new group  We would lose all the posts or maybe export them to a downloadable archive as was done in the past.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />We could start a new group for &quot;free&quot; but it isn't clear how long this &quot;free&quot; group might stay &quot;free.&quot;  Also, we would inevitably see ads.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Posting in indoor_construction has fallen off a lot in recent years.  We need to decide whether this forum is something we want to continue, and, if so, how to proceed.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Please post your input.
