Hi all,
<br />
I did some googling about the reasons for this shutdown. In short, Yahoo
<br />
groups are pre-social network information exchange tool.
<br />
So, giant IT company recognized it's out of date and shutting it down.
<br />
Why are we trying to save 18 years old IT technology? There were talks here
<br />
about saving the archive, 100Mb or something. These days it's nothing.
<br />
<br />Personally, I find it of very little use for my indoor free flight
<br />
activities (does not mean it's a bad/useless thing).
<br />
My time goes ~ 75% to Facebook, ~20% to indoornewsandviews and the
<br />
remaining ~5% to HIP forum.
<br />
<br />If we want to attract new people to the hobby, we would have to keep up
<br />
with modern IT.
<br />
By the way, my kids, (10yo and 15yo), say that Facebook is for old farts.
<br />
Cool kids hang out in Snap Chat and Instagram.
<br />
<br /><br />Regards,
<br />
= Dima
<br />

&gt;
&gt; As Yahoo Groups is shutting down, I've been asked to become the owner and
&gt; moderator for whatever this group is going to become. One existing owner is
&gt; becoming a moderator and other will stay on as co-owner.
&gt;
&gt; The reason I am writing this is to ask - Where do we go from here?
&gt;
&gt; I joined this group when I got back into indoor FF and loved it for what
&gt; it is.
&gt; Over the years, some of the activity has moved to Hip Pocket's Indoor
&gt; forum.
&gt; And more recently, we have seen an uptick in activity on Facebook in
&gt; Bill/Dima Silin's Indoor Free Flight group.
&gt;
&gt; Given the lack of time we have, it is very likely that we will move to
&gt; Groups.io
&gt; I look at this and think that this same thing must be happening across all
&gt; FF Yahoo groups.
&gt; And I wonder if there is not some way to coordinate this across other FF
&gt; groups on Yahoo. If you know of groups like this, please let me know. Maybe
&gt; we can coordinate.
&gt;
&gt; Which gets us to the heart of the matter: None of these offering are
&gt; really ideal for sharing information. They compete with each other
&gt; somewhat, each offering having their own strengths and weaknesses. In a
&gt; sense, we need curated content that is easy to search. We need to be able
&gt; to ask question, learn from each other and share our knowledge.
&gt;
&gt; So the question becomes: What do we want out of the group?
&gt; 1. Basic emailed questions/threads?
&gt; 2. Daily digests?
&gt; 3. Web front end to read/search group threads? (must have good search
&gt; tool!)
&gt; 4. File sharing?
&gt; 5. RSS feed?
&gt; 6. What else?
&gt;
&gt; What do you get out of this group that Hip Pocket and Facebook do not
&gt; provide?
&gt;
&gt; Anything else I am missing?
&gt;
&gt; Regards.
&gt; Mike Kirda
&gt; P.S. I can be reached directly via my propblocks gmail account if needed.
