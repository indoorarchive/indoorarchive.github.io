Im with Jake, prefer having the same setup available. I just know we can have all three, an email based setup and a discussion forum mirroring the emails, which makes searching easier and an INAV style Wordpress news section, which of course requires someone to post content. Then we can each pick how we want to use it.

<br />That said I don’t have a horse in this race, I’m building my first F1L and hopefully an F1D test build but by this time next year I may be reduced to flying in my living room with Ministicks. Perhaps my last season with a class 2 facility.

<br />I have no interest in visiting yet another website. I like this list specifically because I can manage it with email. I'm a member at HPA, but I almost never visit anymore. If we no longer have a mailing list, then I'll just use FB to communicate.

<br />According to .Groups.IO site, it's all ad free.  Three tiers of membership.  Free, $10/month, and $200/month.  The relevant (to us at least) differences in tiers seems to be storage space.  Free is 1G, $10/month gets 10 Gig.  Anyone know how to estimate the storage needed for Ind_Construction archives, photos and files?  I'm sure Yahoo knows.

<br />Yahoo Groups is going away soon.  Where do we want to go with indoor_construction?  Is this forum something we want to keep going?  Or has it been made redundant by other forums like Hip Pocket?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />It isn't clear where or how this group can be migrated with all posts and files intact.  Apparently it isn't practical or possible to move it to Google.  Groups.io has been recommended but in order to migrate this group to Groups.io requires a paid subscription. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Another option might be to start a new group and just copy whatever files are still relevant to the new group  We would lose all the posts or maybe export them to a downloadable archive as was done in the past.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />We could start a new group for &quot;free&quot; but it isn't clear how long this &quot;free&quot; group might stay &quot;free.&quot;  Also, we would inevitably see ads.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Posting in indoor_construction has fallen off a lot in recent years.  We need to decide whether this forum is something we want to continue, and, if so, how to proceed.
<br />

<br />Please post your input.
