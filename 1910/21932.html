&nbsp;Thanks Steven.  What some regard as &quot;considerable disagreement,&quot; I saw as (mostly) members describing what features and format they prefer. Some want email group listserv and others want message board.  There a very few ready-made platforms that do both. Yahoo Groups was a free ride.
<br />
I didnt raise the annual $220 for automatic transfer, (but got almost half that in pledges) Therefore I did the &quot;Start a Group&quot; option.  So, we migrants will have do some walking this evening and tomorrow, but I predict you will like our destination. The new group site is not listed in Groups.io public directory yet, but I will send this group an invitation.  You probably will need a Group.io registration first, then use the link I will post here.MB

<br /><br />Reiterating that this group is support for a tertiary  modeling  activity for me.. Its seems there is considerable disagreement over what direction should be taken moving forward. 
<br />
<br />As previously stated, I favor dealing with it as our own website based, whatever we want deal. That said, given the lack of a unified decision, perhaps the best path is to do the free Group.IO move and continue discussion.
<br />
<br />&nbsp; 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;That way nothing is lost, no money spent and our options remain open. If the majority is happy with Group.IO as a status quo, then the transition is done. 
<br />
<br />It also occurs to me that with 900 members there would be much more activity, moving the group will serve to show who at the least are actively interested as those who fail to respond to the invite will by default be excluded. Then if for example the group is 100 people we will know the true size of this community- It goes without saying, with 900 members we can afford to do anything we want and with 100 it might become an issue of do we want a paid service, be it website or other with recurring dues involved.  
<br />
<br />&nbsp; 
<br />
<br />To me its all about doing whatever provides the best way to encourage involvement and the more resources available the better.  Unfortunately we may not be the best group to understand what will appeal to younger modelers as I believe we are dominated by an aging community, and perhaps there is little that can be done to improve participation regardless. I see this in all phases of airplane modeling, so perhaps the issues are  due to factors out of our control.

<br /> Both SB and I (current owner) asked similar question a few days ago, and the vibe I received from a few is that Ind_Const fulfills a small but important niche for a small but important group. So I'm &quot;going conservative&quot;. Niche means we are not trying to be as good as Hippocket, Facebook, or others. Our primary useful feature seems to be as an old-fashioned list-serve email group. 2. The next useful feature seems to be the 69 reference files members have added since 2006. 3.The message archives? Not sure whether members still reference old messages. Has anyone missed the archives of Don Slu's defunct Yahoo Indoor Group? Anyone can and does ask the same indoor questions over and over, with no lack of expert responses. Or maybe other &quot;indoor issues&quot; are important to preserve. I dont know. But here's a chance for anyone to support, financially, the direct copying and setup of Indoor_Construction onto the Groups.io platform. Right now (9am, 10/22) the sevice just increased to $220. But the &quot;New Group Build&quot; is still available for free. I can do that- start new group for free, invite all members to join (via this list) and copy our 69 Files individually. The message archives can sit until Dec 14, and can be copied by other programs or services. The Yahoo service that claimed to be able to copy message  archives all at once into another place did not work. (No surprise.)  Any member here can copy and paste their own photos (or anyone else's photos on this site) supposedly until Dec. 14.
<br />
<br />&nbsp; 
<br />
<br />To purchase the aforementioned &quot;convenient and complete group transfer&quot; option, anyone here wish to donate?  $3 per actual user might do nicely. I'll donate $25.  PM me at F1diddler_at_yahoo.com.
<br />
<br />Mark
<br />
<br />(PS, these companies, Yahoo, Groups.io, etc. are jiggering the rules by the hour. I am merely reporting in good faith, and still learning.)
