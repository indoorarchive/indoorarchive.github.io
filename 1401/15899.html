The reason why F1A, F1B, and F1C have flourished is because the BOM rule was dropped. No one builds his own. They all purchase it, and have tons of fun.
<br />
Indoors, who cares who built it.
<br />
It's the flight duration that determines the winner. That's the most difficult part.
<br />
Of course buying components from an expert will benefit everyone. If I can't equal their workmanship my flight duration will be compromised.
<br />
The end result will be negative. Why should I spent thousands on travel expenses when I don't have a chance of winning the WC. More than likely I would quit.
<br />
Case in point, the WC is won by the almost the same experts time after time. Ciao, Phedon.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have never wanted to fly anything I haven’t made (and designed) and even now I don’t fly P30 because one must buy the propeller.  So I was quite content with the BOM rule and never thought much about it until I had a spell as Chairman of the Free Flight Technical Committee of the BMFA and then I had to think hard but truth to tell it was a ‘No Brainer’ for International Classes.  One look at the Rule Book, a jumbled half a page of what you could and could not buy capped by the phrase that, if asked by the CD, the competitor must explain to the CD how he made the part.  It was obvious that a sensible BOM rule could not be written or enforced.  I moved over to support those in favour of removing the BOM rule (except for classes such as scale) and this occurred a few years later.  There were endless acrimonious arguments about the BOM rule when it was still in force but in the 10 years or so since it went there has hardly been a ripple of discontent.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I should like to enlarge a little on the words I italicised above ‘for International Classes’.  International Championships are for finding the person (or persons) who wins under the rules for the class.  Some Championships use complicated equipment: Gliding, Sailing, Model Aeroplanes, Motor racing, others much simpler: tennis racquets, golf clubs, skis, bobsleighs and so on.  In almost every case the equipment will not be made by the competitor and I think that neither the organisers nor the competitors nor indeed the general public would want them to be.  I think in aeromodelling it is much more likely that the organisers will suggest standard machines for all flyers so that the result reflects the skill of the flyer and not the depth of his pocket!  I believe that the possibility of a return (or even a continuation) of BOM for International classes is unlikely.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However I feel that the good side of the above is that it gives the greatest opportunity that aeromodelling has had for many years.  The International flyers are a great and talented group and I follow their exploits with interest but most modellers are too old and too poor to fly at that level.  What is needed is new classes that flyers can build in their own workshops.  Perhaps a class that suits small fields.  Don’t rush things, talk about it, and try it.  And don’t be afraid to change things again in a couple of years; new classes bring out new design and foster interest.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kang, this would be difficult to write as a rule and impossible to enforce at competitions.  Either we have BOM, or we don't.  There is no realistic middle ground.
