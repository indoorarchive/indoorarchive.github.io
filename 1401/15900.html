<br />That is a good question. I would refer to this section:
<br />
*
<br />
**/with &quot;constructed&quot; to be interpreted as the action required to 
<br />
complete a model starting with no more prefabrication than the amount 
<br />
used in the average kit/*
<br />
<br />It then goes to what one defines as an &quot;average kit&quot;. This variation 
<br />
will probably vary from CD to CD on what they believe an average kit to 
<br />
be. If I were CD and that was presented to me I would have to define an 
<br />
&quot;average kit&quot; to make my decision, so I would base it on my personal 
<br />
experiences over the years on kits I have bought or seen for indoor 
<br />
models. I have never seen an AMA indoor kit with preformed balsa blades. 
<br />
The MicroX kits for example like  EZB contained wood, plans, covering, 
<br />
thrust bearings, thrust washers, and wire for prop hook (possibly 
<br />
prebent I don't recall), and some rubber. So in my personal experience I 
<br />
would say such a LPP kit with preformed blades would not be what one 
<br />
would find in an &quot;average kit&quot;. It would be an above average kit. 
<br />
Additionally I don't think the existence of one or two kits with 
<br />
preshaped blades included would be enough to redefine those  kits as the 
<br />
new &quot;average&quot; and the rest of the kits as below average. How exactly to 
<br />
redefine the &quot;average kit&quot; to include preformed blades as the new norm 
<br />
is unclear. So I think it will come down to a CD by CD basis.
<br />
<br />In regards to BOM. There are aspects of building indoor models which I 
<br />
do not particularly enjoy and I have to push through that when I build. 
<br />
So I can understand why people would want to buy something instead. In 
<br />
my years of indoor I have only flown one VP prop at two contests. It was 
<br />
on my Int stick and I flew it in Buffalo before USIC one year and won in 
<br />
Buffalo and then won USIC that year. I personally hate building VP props 
<br />
with a passion. I just do. I don't know why but I dread making one like 
<br />
getting I dread a root canal. I somehow think of me making one as giving 
<br />
up for not being able to correctly design a prop (how messed up is that! 
<br />
:-) ) Consequently I have gone out of my way to make model/designs to 
<br />
sidestep VPs as much as possible in events that allow it. In F1D now it 
<br />
is mandatory to be able to control the energy release. In the old days a 
<br />
big old flare prop would get you close. What I am trying to say is in 
<br />
that one instance I used a VP and won I was very happy with the 
<br />
accomplishment. If that VP hub had been bought and I used it and won the 
<br />
victory to me would be completely hollow as the VP is an important 
<br />
mechanism in making the model fly well. My satisfaction from indoor 
<br />
models is combination of the building and flying. I prefer the flying 
<br />
aspect and when successful the having built it is aspect enhances the 
<br />
satisfaction for me the two are intertwined with each other. I can not 
<br />
imagine the two separated but that is my view on how it is for me.
<br />
<br />In the golf analogy posted earlier, I don't think of BOM as a golfer 
<br />
having to make his clubs I think of the club as the equivalent of a 
<br />
thrust bearing. I would analogize the BOM rule as to playing a hole in 
<br />
golf. So buying a premade VP hub would be like having some one hit the 
<br />
ball of the tee for you then you finishing the hole from there, and 
<br />
buying a whole model ready to fly would be like making the putt once 
<br />
someone else got the ball to the green. You can argue that golf is won 
<br />
in the short game so who cares about that drive and approach shot :-)
