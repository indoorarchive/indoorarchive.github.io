Iskandar,
<br />
<br />I have heard through the grapevine from someone who claims to know all about rubber what the difference is. There is a single additive that was used in the production of TanII. For some reason the source dried up and was no longer included. Hence the relatively poor energy return out of TanSS. 
<br />
<br />Apparently they recently got some more of the additive and used it and the newer TanSS is essentially the same as the older TanII. 
<br />
<br />TanII (when made) was made (supposedly) in exactly the same way from batch to batch. Why some was so much better than others is unknown.
<br />
<br />Chances are that some of the newest TanSS will eventually be as good or better than 5/99. The only way to know is to test it. And remember that what works best for say Wakefield may not be best for A6.
<br />
So much of it is the torque curve and that varies batch to batch.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. 
<br />
<br />Regards.
<br />
Mike Kirda

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have a question about good batches of Tan Super Sport. We have a small group here (in Kuala Lumpur) flying indoor (until recently - we've lost our excellent flying site, hope to find another soon). Three of us (myself not included) were building A6s for a friendly postal contest with fliers from Thailand, and we noticed that the rubber belonging to one of us was markedly better than what the others were using. By quite a bit. So much so that when he lent a motor to another flier the recipient immediately beat HIS time (we're talking about 6+ minutes under a 60 foot ceiling) even though the lendee was about a minute short before that fateful flight...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Anyhow, the good batch was Tan Super Sport bought directly from FAI maybe a year ago. I bought some from A2Z around August, we tested it, it's nowhere near as good. In the November Model Aviation, the statement that the &quot;latest batches&quot; of Super Sport have been extremely good was made (though it didn't compare to the legendary 5/99 batch of Tan II). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  So:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  a) Did something drastic happen maybe a year ago, which made all subsequent batches of Super Sport superior to what came before, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  b) Did this continue with all subsequent batches? Would it be worth ordering some of it now from FAI? Getting a pound of rubber here is fairly expensive, the shipping costs about the same as the rubber. I would if the current batch is as good as what my friend here has.
