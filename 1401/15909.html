<br />Kang,
<br />
<br />I never really looked at the FAI definition until posted here. What it 
<br />
says it not what I thought it said.  I think the FAI rule is vague 
<br />
enough to allow the buying of parts, many parts actually. The AMA goes 
<br />
an extra step to try and define &quot;constructed&quot;.  The FAI rule says you 
<br />
have to be the &quot;builder&quot;, and no further explanation so by dictionary 
<br />
definition a builder  means &quot;one who builds&quot;, then builds means &quot;to make 
<br />
(something) by putting together parts or materials&quot;. Interstingly 
<br />
&quot;assemle&quot; is &quot;to connect or put together the parts of (something, such 
<br />
as a toy or machine)&quot;  so I would interpret as some building is required 
<br />
as opposed to simple assembly or connecting of premade parts (similar to 
<br />
what the AMA calls out as not allowed).  So buying a hub and adding prop 
<br />
blades to it would to me seem legal under the FAI definition same with 
<br />
buying a premade prop outline as it would require additional building to 
<br />
add the ribs, cover, and connect to the VP hub. If the prop blades were 
<br />
all premade and just required assembly (plugged into the hub) then I 
<br />
would think it is not allowed by the FAI. So I would think more prefab 
<br />
is OK for F1D where AMA does not allow the same prefab level with the 
<br />
&quot;average kit&quot; wording. So like I was saying before If you buy prefab F1D 
<br />
parts and want to fly AMA HLS with the same model it would be FAI legal 
<br />
but AMA illegal. I have to admit my gut reaction to buying VP hubs and 
<br />
prop outlines for F1D was it was a BOM violation but I was applying the 
<br />
AMA definition as I understood it, but the FAI definition being vague to 
<br />
me allows more leniency. Personally I would not be in support of 
<br />
allowing purchased premade VP hubs but the FAI rule as currently written 
<br />
does not guide me enough (speaking on a CD basis) to disqualify its use 
<br />
for F1D, F1M, or F1R at a contest.
