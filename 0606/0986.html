How about the following...
<br />
<br />- website that can have &quot;entries&quot; submitted and approved, and a
<br />
real-time display of the results and classifications...  I'll put it
<br />
together and host it, and make the database and code available in case
<br />
I get run over by a truck...
<br />
<br />- I did some pricing on stickers today, and even though they aren't
<br />
really expensive on a per sticker basis, the minimums are pretty
<br />
high...  So in rethinking that part, maybe have a email certificate
<br />
(that they can print out... pdf or something...) emailed to them for
<br />
the first few levels, and reserve the sticker (or patch etc...) for
<br />
the highest levels... maybe even a t-shirt or something if you get to
<br />
the highest level or recognition...  We can always make up the design
<br />
and print the stickers individually on an inkjet, but I do think that
<br />
having something that you can put on your toolbox or model box or wear
<br />
is something that quite a few will strive for...
<br />
<br />- In regards to the above idea, maybe something like the Boy Scouts
<br />
have...  Badges for achievements, and something to put them all on...
<br />
&nbsp;which might lead to having a list of &quot;recognized contests&quot;, and
<br />
placing in one of them would get you an event star...  problem is that
<br />
some of you guys will have a -really- long sash...  lol  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously though, I think offering a badge/decal/t-shirt/whatever at
<br />
cost, and a certificate for free, would be acceptable for most if not
<br />
all...  that way no organization has to underwrite the cost
<br />
initially...  The LSF seems to do something like that with a mug, and
<br />
since I spent a long time as a golf pro, I still have -many- resources
<br />
to get awards sourced with engraving, etc...
<br />
<br />- Names for the levels...  need that before we start trying to design
<br />
things...
<br />
<br />- Let's get a solid consensus of events to start with...  I guess I'm
<br />
not only looking for -just- beginner events, but a good subset of
<br />
indoor duration events that both beginners and veterans can
<br />
participate with...  So far I have seen the following:
<br />
<br />IHLG
<br />
F1L
<br />
Limited Pennyplane
<br />
A6
<br />
<br />I would also suggest adding the following, since they are FAI events:
<br />
F1D
<br />
F1M
<br />
<br />I also like the idea of SO so as to get those kids involved...
<br />
<br />and I think that you have a pretty good start...  more can always be
<br />
added over time...  
<br />
<br />- I know that -I'm- not qualified to come up with durations for levels
<br />
for most of the above, but if we can agree on the number of levels and
<br />
the events to start with, then I am willing to start on the other
<br />
stuff, and work with whomever I can find on the graphics design... 
<br />
<br />- We need suggestions for a name for the whole thing...  one of my
<br />
problems is that I'm not that creative, but I'm sure that some are out
<br />
there...  let's get some ideas going and vote on things...  
<br />
Indoor Duration 
<br />
Indoor Duration Society
<br />
Indoor Duration Fliers
<br />
Indoor Duration Achievement
<br />
<br /><br />BTW, the LSF site is -filled- with great ideas...  I might try to take
<br />
some of them and type something up for review in the next few days...

<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am very glad to see this recognition idea taking off.  I really liked 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it when I read it in the first round of messages.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With all due respect to Mark B. (and just how much is that?) I see the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; efforts to create &quot;beginner class&quot; designs and rules a futile effort.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The stickers sound like a complication to me.  LSF (league of Silent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Flight) sends a written notice (could be emailed) and posts your level 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the web page.  The more that can be done electronically the better, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as that will keep down expenses.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Someone will need to do the record keeping and updating, of course.
</em><br />
&nbsp;And 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we do not need someone asking, &quot;How do we know he did that time?&quot;  The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; achievment is inside the person, and that is what counts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
