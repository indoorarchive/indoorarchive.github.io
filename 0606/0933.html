The general rule in all indoor competition and in just about any other type of competition is &quot;if it doesn't say you can't then you can&quot;.
<br />
<br />If you enter any event at USIC you can expect to do battle with many of the very best fliers in the US. At my first USIC I flew a 3.1 gram limited penny plane and finished in 37th place.
<br />
<br />Nothing about my A6 model bent any of the rules in any way. All you have to do to get down to 1.2 grams is to buy some 4 psf wood. It's readily available. There's really no good reason to expect a 2.5 gram model to compete with a 1.2 gram model.
<br />
<br />Everything that I know about A6 I've learned from asking on this list. Nearly all of the info that I received was in the form of public messages. If anyone really wants to be able to fly this event on a competitive level a good first step would be to listen to what the masters have to say.
<br />
<br />On a different note: 
<br />
After hearing some of the controversies about this event I've decided against getting involved in trying to make it an AMA event. From here out I will fly A6 when it suits my purposes and keep my mouth shut about it otherwise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: [Indoor_Construction] A-6 rules
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As a relatively newcomer to competitive indoor model building it seems 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to me that you might want to keep the rules to A-6 somewhat simple to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;perhaps attract more people to this hobby. Seems to me that if you 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;start trying to figure out all kinds of ways to get around the rules 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that have been laid down and rely on the builder/flyers ability to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;TRIM an airplane and make it fly rather than try to concote all kinds 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of way to twist the rules, then you are just going to have the same 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;bunch of people showing up for the competition year after year. I flew 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A-6 at the USIC and had 3 HEAVY models that were nowhere near 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;competitive. I don't have the building experience that all you guys 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;do, so I didn't have a chance, and to a certain extent it was somewhat 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;intimidating to fly my 2.5g models against 1.2's. But if you guys are 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;going to make this event into a pro event maybe it wouldn't be worth 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;me trying to make a 1.2 model because, if I got to that point, then 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;there's a whole new slant that has to be overcome for me to have any 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;kind of chance. Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought A-6 was supposed to be 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;kind of a stepping stone into more competitive modeling. You guys 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;probably think this guys full of hot air/too bad he can't build 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;better, but this is just how I see it.
<br />
