I missed the earlier discussion but this sounds like a GREAT idea! Maybe NFFS could pick up on this. The awards would not have to be costly. In fact it might be nothing more than having your name put on a list. It would give new fliers something to work towards where they wouldn't have to beat the &quot;experts&quot;. Also maybe there could be an achievement ladder for several different common events.
<br />
<br />Jeff, your website would be a good place to keep this if no &quot;official&quot; group is interested.
<br />
<br />What would it take to get this started? Any ideas from the membership? I might try to do something like this in my local club.

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately you won't end up in the hospital if you crash and burn on 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;your first &quot;high end&quot; model (although your ego may take a hit).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As I'm fond of pointing out (mostly 'cause I like ribbing them), many 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of our top youngsters build first F1D's that were, to put is as 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;nicely as I can, pieces of cr*p. But their second ones sure 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;weren't. And before long these guys were at the top of the heap.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Doesn't mean we don't need beginner events though. We had a sidebar 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;discussion on this a couple of months ago that evolved my opinion. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I think a good beginner event is defined by:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Elimination of some complexities (at the expense of extra rules). 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make it a little easier to build decent model. Note that I didn't 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;easiest&quot;, since that is largely up for debate. Some people 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;thing film covering is easy, others think tissue is easy, and a more 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;than a few think microfilm is easy. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Accessibility. Contrary to some opinion, I think challenges are 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;good and motivating for beginners. But accessible challenges. It's 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;not too much fun to start with a design that calls for all kinds of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;hard to obtain materials (at least for a beginner).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- An achievement goal that has nothing to do with the other people 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(aka experts) who might fly the event. This was my biggest 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;revelation from that other discussion. My favorite proposal is 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;modeled after R/C Soaring's League of Silent Flight program 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(www.silentflight.org). In that, you fulfill a defined set of tasks 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to work your way from LSF Level I to Level IV (Level I is pretty 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;easy - a relatively short slope / thermal flight and 3 spot landings -
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;but still a good beginner goal). In our case we might want to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;define something like a 5 minute LPP flight. Give out an achievement 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;patch or stickers. The target stays the same regardless of &quot;expert&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;involvement, and the beginner has something rewarding to shoot for.
