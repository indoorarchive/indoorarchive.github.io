Hi Barry
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As a relatively newcomer to competetive indoor model building it
</em><br />
seems to me that you might want to keep the rules to A-6 somewhat
<br />
simple to  perhaps attract more people to this hobby. 
<br />
<br />I agree on that simple rules are better, and the A-6 rules are not the
<br />
most simple ones. But, in my opinion there is good reason for that...
<br />
<br />A-6 is a beginning class, and by seting min part sizes (ribs, spars,
<br />
propeller blades thikness) will make you work with balsa wood in order
<br />
to build a light A-6 model. If you dont select your balsa, you cant
<br />
get into a competitive weight. 
<br />
<br />Nobody prohibits if somebody goes to a contest with a non-competitive
<br />
model. Its not all about wining, you can have big time, even just lookin.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Seems to me that if you  start trying to figure out all kinds of ways
</em><br />
to get around the rules  that have been laid down and rely on the
<br />
builder/flyers ability to TRIM an airplane and make it fly rather than
<br />
try to concote all kinds of way to twist the rules, then you are just
<br />
going to have the same bunch of people showing up for the competition
<br />
year after year.
<br />
<br />Nobody, I think, is trying to get arround rules. All discussion was
<br />
about some clarifications on what can be done or what can not. Other
<br />
classes have more simple and clear rules than A-6 ones.
<br />
<br />It is very important thr trimming on free flight, specialy in indoor
<br />
free flight. The main goal of this trimming is to maximize endurance.
<br />
<br />Fairing, using special hooks, special o-rings, covering both sideas of
<br />
wing and things like that aren't for get arround rules. I think
<br />
all that can be done in ministicks, EZB and others. But people dont do
<br />
that because is not nescesary on those classes. In A-6 probably will
<br />
improve times, and that is all about, challenge against the clock.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I flew  A-6 at the USIC and had 3 HEAVY models that were nowhere
</em><br />
near competitive. I don't have the building experience that all you
<br />
guys do, so I didn't have a chance, and to a certain extent it was
<br />
somewhat intimidating to fly my 2.5g models against 1.2's. 
<br />
<br />Its very hard to be part in a contest with a model twice as heavy than
<br />
others. Much more harder will be to win. But you times
<br />
arent bad for su much weight. 
<br />
<br />Barry, its not hard to save some weight... just select your balsa.
<br />
find a 36&quot; x 3&quot; sheet 1/16 thikness that weight 9 grams. That will be
<br />
#5 balsa. Cut many spars with a striper, then weight each of them 
<br />
and use the light ones. Use small amount of glue.  For motorstick use
<br />
a sligly hard balsa (#6) and for propeller cut blades from #4 balsa. 
<br />
Spary very small amount of 3m77 to attach condenser paper. Use music
<br />
wire 0.012&quot; for hook and aluminium bearing.  
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But if you guys are going to make this event into a pro event maybe
</em><br />
it wouldn't be worth me trying to make a 1.2 model because, if I got
<br />
to that point, then  there's a whole new slant that has to be overcome
<br />
for me to have any kind of chance. 
<br />
<br />Im sure that for any help you need you will find here (and in
<br />
contests) many people to give you a hand. But is not possible to make
<br />
people to not turn into &quot;pro&quot; a starting class. All  wants to do the
<br />
best time!! :)
<br />
<br />Here, in our principiant class, there was a rummor that the winner of
<br />
the nationall class can not longer compete in that class on following
<br />
nationals. Still its only a rummor, but probably a good idea.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought A-6 was supposed to be  kind of a
</em><br />
stepping stone into more competitive modeling. You guys  probably
<br />
think this guys full of hot air/too bad he can't build  better, but
<br />
this is just how I see it.
<br />
<br />Not me. And sure you can :)
<br />
<br />Regards. 
<br />
<br />Ignacio.
