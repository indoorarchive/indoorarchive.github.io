I've often wondered what the comparison would be between a rectangular
<br />
piece of balsa and a round one of equal weight in terms of bending
<br />
deflection and torsional deflection. Today I decided to stop wondering
<br />
and see if I could find out.
<br />
<br />I cut 2 pieces of balsa side by side from a 1/4&quot; sheet of C-grain wood.
<br />
<br />One piece was .130 x .245 x 12&quot; and weighed .44g. The C-grain was on
<br />
the narrow face. It buckled toward the thin side at 180g and toward
<br />
the thick side at something over 500g. (this was a hard number to get)
<br />
<br />The other piece was sanded round in my post maker. The diameter was
<br />
reduced until a 12&quot; piece weighed the same .44g as the rectangular
<br />
piece. The final diameter was .195&quot;. The buckling load for this piece
<br />
was 360g. This was an unexpected result.
<br />
<br />Next I set up a cantilever deflection test. I fixed one end of the
<br />
round piece and put enough weight on it to deflect it about 5/8&quot;. I
<br />
rotated the piece a number of times to see if it was stronger
<br />
depending on the grain orientation. The maximum difference in
<br />
deflection from the best position to the worst position was about
<br />
1/16&quot;. This was also unexpected.
<br />
<br />The same amount of weight on the rectangular piece with the strong
<br />
axis vertical was 7/16&quot;. This result was expected.
<br />
<br />For the torsional deflection test I put a hook in the end of each
<br />
piece and a straight piece of wire through each end so that at rest
<br />
the 2 straight wires were in the same plane. With a .5 in-oz load
<br />
applied to the hooks, the round piece deflected about 23 degrees and
<br />
the rectangular piece deflected about 29 degrees. This was expected
<br />
except that I thought the round piece would be even better than it was
<br />
in this test.
<br />
<br />This was all done in a not very scientific way. If you find the
<br />
results interesting for any reason you might want to try it yourself.
