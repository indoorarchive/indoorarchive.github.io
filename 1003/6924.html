I welcome all of your comments.
<br />
I was probably unclear in my previous postings.  I didn't mean to say
<br />
that the partial motor method is flawed.  Rather, that I implemented it
<br />
incorrectly.
<br />
In the 1/6 partial motor experiment where I used a 0.5g motor and a
<br />
dummy motor that weighed 2.5g, I was able to consistently achieve 25' of
<br />
climb and a duration of 2:50, with a max of 3:02.  But I implemented
<br />
this method incorrectly because my dummy motor was too short.  With a
<br />
full hook to hook distance of about 9&quot;, a 1/6 motor correctly applied
<br />
should be used with a dummy motor of 7.5&quot;.  The 1/6 motor, about 4&quot; long
<br />
when unwound, should be attached with a hook to hook distance of 1.5&quot;. 
<br />
In my first experiments, I used a dummy motor of 6&quot; long, so that the
<br />
1/6 motor was attached with a hook to hook distance of 3.0&quot;.  In these
<br />
first experiments, the results were good.
<br />
In the second experiments, I used the correct dummy motor length of
<br />
7.5&quot;.  The wound motor when attached was only 1.5&quot; long. But in this new
<br />
experiment, the plane climbed less than 20' with a duration of about
<br />
2:30.   The initial unwind seemed weak, the climb was weaker than
<br />
before, and the flights ended with lots of turns left.
<br />
(I also tried the full 3.0g motor to observe the full winding and
<br />
unwinding.  I noticed the lack of tail hook clearance, which I changed. 
<br />
I noticed that the initial unwind seemed weak as well.  The behavior
<br />
seemed consistent with my second experiments where I applied the partial
<br />
motor method correctly.  I did not fly with the full 3.0g motor to avoid
<br />
damage in the ceiling.)
<br />
I did not use a sleeve.  I know that it's possible for the rubber to get
<br />
caught between the prop hook and the MS, but I did not see it in the 4
<br />
or 5 times that I unwound the motor.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry if this has already been discussed but are you using sleeves?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As far as a full motor having less power - how did you determine that?
</em><br />
Are you taking torque readings while unwinding the motor? It doesn't
<br />
make sense that a full motor would have less initial power than a
<br />
partial motor unless knots are dragging somewhere. A full motor wound to
<br />
the same maximum torque and backed off to the same launch torque should
<br />
deliver the same launch torque (power in your terms) as the partial
<br />
motor but more importantly it should do it for much longer. For example
<br />
the number of unwinding turns from .7 in-oz to .5 in-oz in the full
<br />
motor should be six times as many as in the 1/6 motor. This is why the
<br />
whole partial motor concept works.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another potential problem is if the motor is new and the rubber is
</em><br />
still stretching your .7 in-oz of launch torque may really be a lot less
<br />
by the time you get the motor on the model.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; None of this is intended to sound preachy. I'm just trying to figure
</em><br />
out where you are in the learning curve.
