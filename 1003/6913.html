Circa 2003 or 2004, I announced my own &quot;Kremer Prize&quot; which amounted to my offering to pay admission fee to USIC for anyone who had broken the Cat III or Cat IV AMA record in IHLG.  My intention
<br />
was to incite,  spur development of the new concept,  &quot;Tip Launched Hand Launched Glider.&quot;  At the time, I didn't think such a concept could exceed the best flyers in traditional javelin-lauch HLG.  Yet, I would be glad to &quot;pay for&quot; being proven wrong!   Hence my challenge.   
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Circa 2007, I posted (here on Indoor_Contruction) that not much was happening in TLG development, and therefore reneiged on my offer.  Not so appropriate, since the original English Channel  &quot;Kremer Prize&quot; contained no such time limit.   The larger truth was I had lost my job, and didn't want to pay the the $45 I offered (USIC entry fee with one event.)    
<br />
<br />See, I had just lost my school teaching career due to scooping up a teary eyed 5 year-old boy in my arms.   He had been thrown onto a dusty playground due to trying to play with 11 years-olds who didn't want him.  His 12 year-old sibling happened by and commented, &quot;That's gay.  I'm telling my mother.&quot;  Two days later I was fired, without being personally questioned by investigators.  18 months of unemployment was the result.  Such is life in USA, regardless what you hear...
<br />
<br />Presently reemployed now in the field of caring for the developmentally disabled. So, am reinstating my ersatz &quot;Kremer Prize&quot; and will hope that Stan Buddenbohm will take advantage of it, either this year or next year. He has already qualified, obviously. End of story.
<br />
<br />Why do I even care about IHLG since I only fly rubber power?   HLG was my first  love in  FF. In my 30s, I could throw Sweepettes to 90 or 95 feet high (outdoor) with nice transitions.  Best model got regular 63s in still air.  Think I got a second place beating one of  of the Buddenbohm brothers at Lost Hills, circa 1997 or 1998.  Bob Deshields first place, and rightly so.
<br />
<br />Friends of Stan, tell him to come to USIC this year. Entry paid.
<br />
