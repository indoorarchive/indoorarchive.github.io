Dear INAV subscribers and friends:
<br />
<br />I am writing to provide a long overdue update with regards to the status of INAV.  As most are aware, we did not publish a new issue last year.  The responsibility for this lies squarely on my shoulders, and I hope you can all accept my sincere apologies.  We have issue #124 about 95% complete, and I hope to have it in the mail prior to USIC.  In addition, we are going to extend everyone's subscription by a year to make up for the lost time.  
<br />
<br />There are a number of reasons for the lack of a new issue last year, but in sum it comes down to time.  As some of you know, the last few years I have been working towards partnership at my law firm, and was elected as a partner this year.  With the economic downturn, maintaining and growing my practice has taken significantly more time than I anticipated, with 70-80 hour weeks being the norm.  Similarly, my co-editor, and all around awesome guy, Jeff Hood has taken over the operations at his business, and is also working extremely long hours with much more limited free time than before.  
<br />
<br />Accordingly, I am writing to the Indoor community to seek help.  INAV is a wonderful publication with a long history, and we want to keep it going strong.  In order to accomplish our goals, we need some assistance.  In particular, we need some folks to assist with layout and design.  Second, we really need more material.  It took about a year to get enough material to prepare the current issue.  With that said, I have been negligent in haranguing folks for new material, and could use some assistance with gathering and editing articles.  
<br />
<br />Now, the pay is crappy (ok &#x2013; there is no pay at all), and it takes away from your building/flying time.  But there is great satisfaction when a new issue goes out, and getting one or two &quot;good jobs&quot; from your flying buddies is pretty cool too.  
<br />
<br />I hope this open letter helps to explain the lack of new issues and may encourage a few folks to join our volunteer staff and keep this great publication moving forward.  Please do not hesitate to contact me directly with any comments, concerns, or complaints.  
<br />
<br />Respectfully, 
<br />
<br />Tony Pavel   
<br />
