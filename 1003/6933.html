Bill, how about a tutorial on sleeves ?  What material, how long,
<br />
placement, etc

<br />
In a contest where you get 5 tries and there are usually time restraints
<br />
a fouled prop can ruin your chances. A record trial is a different animal
<br />
from a contest. At a record trial if your prop locks up while the model
<br />
is 75' up you can always (maybe) put up another flight. 
<br />
<br />Whether you use sleeves or not is a matter of choice. For me I would
<br />
never try to run a 24&quot; motor on an LPP without sleeves. I sometimes use
<br />
sleeves in Cat 1.

<br />
I welcome all of your comments.   
<br />
<br /><br />I was probably unclear in my previous postings.  I didn't mean to say
<br />
that the partial motor method is flawed.  Rather, that I implemented it
<br />
incorrectly.
<br />
<br /><br />In the 1/6 partial motor experiment where I used a 0.5g motor and a dummy
<br />
motor that weighed 2.5g, I was able to consistently achieve 25' of climb
<br />
and a duration of 2:50, with a max of 3:02.  But I implemented this
<br />
method incorrectly because my dummy motor was too short.  With a full
<br />
hook to hook distance of about 9&quot;, a 1/6 motor correctly applied should
<br />
be used with a dummy motor of 7.5&quot;.  The 1/6 motor, about 4&quot; long when
<br />
unwound, should be attached with a hook to hook distance of 1.5&quot;.  In my
<br />
first experiments, I used a dummy motor of 6&quot; long, so that the 1/6 motor
<br />
was attached with a hook to hook distance of 3.0&quot;.  In these first
<br />
experiments, the results were good.
<br />
<br /><br />In the second experiments, I used the correct dummy motor length of 7.5&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;The wound motor when attached was only 1.5&quot; long. But in this new
<br />
experiment, the plane climbed less than 20' with a duration of about
<br />
2:30.   The initial unwind seemed weak, the climb was weaker than before,
<br />
and the flights ended with lots of turns left.
<br />
<br /><br />(I also tried the full 3.0g motor to observe the full winding and
<br />
unwinding.  I noticed the lack of tail hook clearance, which I changed. 
<br />
I noticed that the initial unwind seemed weak as well.  The behavior
<br />
seemed consistent with my second experiments where I applied the partial
<br />
motor method correctly.  I did not fly with the full 3.0g motor to avoid
<br />
damage in the ceiling.)
<br />
<br /><br />I did not use a sleeve.  I know that it's possible for the rubber to get
<br />
caught between the prop hook and the MS, but I did not see it in the 4 or
<br />
5 times that I unwound the motor.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry if this has already been discussed but are you using sleeves?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As far as a full motor having less power - how did you determine that?
</em><br />
Are you taking torque readings while unwinding the motor? It doesn't make
<br />
sense that a full motor would have less initial power than a partial
<br />
motor unless knots are dragging somewhere. A full motor wound to the same
<br />
maximum torque and backed off to the same launch torque should deliver
<br />
the same launch torque (power in your terms) as the partial motor but
<br />
more importantly it should do it for much longer. For example the number
<br />
of unwinding turns from .7 in-oz to .5 in-oz in the full motor should be
<br />
six times as many as in the 1/6 motor. This is why the whole partial
<br />
motor concept works.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another potential problem is if the motor is new and the rubber is
</em><br />
still stretching your .7 in-oz of launch torque may really be a lot less
<br />
by the time you get the motor on the model.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; None of this is intended to sound preachy. I'm just trying to figure
</em><br />
out where you are in the learning curve.
