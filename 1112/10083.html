Gary,
<br />
<br />I looked into discussions that took place on the Yahoo list back in 2003 (the previous one run by Don S.).  The discussion dealt with F1D, o-rings, and spacers.  Recall that F1D has a 1.2g minimum model weight and a 0.6g maximum rubber weight.
<br />
<br />There were two general agreements:
<br />
<br />- metal &quot;spacers&quot; that are removable may be considered part of the model weight
<br />
<br />- o-rings may be removed from the rubber motor after flight (by cutting the o-rings off or by cutting the cubber), then weighed against the 0.6g limit
<br />
<br />However, there was no agreement that o-rings should count as the model weight (even though o-rings do the same thing as a spacer). 
<br />
<br />Here is a post by Steve Brown, who included a quote by Jim Richmond on this topic:
<br />

From:     Steve Brown
<br />
Subject:  Jim Richmond''s response to the wire spacer question
<br />
<br />&quot;The precedent is in outdoor rubber as in F1B. Here, loose metal
<br />
parts are always used at the front or back or both to attach/hold the
<br />
rubber, and they are weighed as part of the plane, not the motor-
<br />
because they are removable. Bobbins and crocket hooks are often used,
<br />
and in F!D, you might say the wire spacer is an indoor crocket hook.
<br />
As for &quot;O&quot; rings, this was discussed between Doig and Andras Ree and
<br />
Ree said &quot;if it's removable, it gets weighed with the plane. If not,
<br />
it's weighed with the motor. End of story&quot;. I have that in writing
<br />
somewhere.
<br />
<br />That still doesn't address cutting off &quot;O&quot; rings for after flight
<br />
weight check. We need to decide if that will be allowed. Did anyone
<br />
actually see this being done in Slanic? Also, my view is that &quot;O&quot;
<br />
rings are not part of the plane wieght unless they are removable so
<br />
they can be weighed with the plane.&quot;
<br />
<br />------
<br />
<br />So, according to this logic, o-rings are not part of the model weight.
<br />
<br />However, most folks (but not all) felt that the o-rings do not have to count toward the motor weight.
<br />
<br />From the standpoint of the accepted practice, I have never witnessed nor heard of any instance where any model has been weighed with o-rings to meet the minimum model weight requirement.
<br />
<br />===
<br />
<br />In terms of motor sleeves -- using the logic from Jim, if the motor sleeve is removable, it can be weighed with the model.  But I believe the same logic also requires that one use the exact same two (or one) sleeves on every flight.
<br />
<br />Now, from the standpoint of accepted practice, I have also never heard of any instance where the motor sleeve is weighed with the model to meet the minimum model weight requirement.
<br />
<br />My *opinion* is that sleeves should not be weighed with the model.  It may not be logical, but it is more in line with accepted practice.  Again, just my opinion.
<br />
<br />===
<br />
<br />I hope this helps!

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kang,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From a practical point of view, perhaps I would agree with you. I am not so sure I agree from a rules interpretation point of view. Who did you check with? What about tube sleeves that slip over the motor? They can be more easily weighed with the model.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I looked into this earlier this year because my model was a little underweight, and I wannted to know if my o-rings could count as part of the model weight.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the rules are not clear on this, but the accepted practice is that o-rings do not count toward the model weight. I think this is the right way and we should continue this practice.
