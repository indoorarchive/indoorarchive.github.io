LeRoy, what is with the replies from you that restate the previous message but you never add anything new?  &amp; your message indicates there is a strange attachment. Have you been hijacked? I have seen several messages like this from your email address.

<br />Personally, If I were the CD, I would not interpret the EZB rule (19.2.11) to prohibit sleeves. I believe the key word is &quot;rate&quot; of energy release. We both agree that the sleeves are intended to prevent knotting. That is not (pun knot intended) the same as a gadget that controls the rate of energy release, IMHO. The problem with the rules is that they are not especially clear.

<br />
<br />Regarding whether &quot;sleeves&quot; are legal. Here are the AMA rules regarding &quot;gadgets&quot; for the three classes: LPP, EZB, and Ministick:
<br />
<br />EZB
<br />
<br />19.2.11. It is prohibited to use any scheme, device, or mechanism which affects the rate of energy release from the rubber motor, except for propeller blade flare or deformation.
<br />
<br />LPP
<br />
<br />21.3.6. No gadgets of any kind are permitted on the model (i.e., variable pitch props, automatic incidence changing mechanisms, etc.).
<br />
<br />Ministick
<br />
<br />24.8. The maximum diameter of the propeller shall be seven (7) inches. The propeller shall be constructed of wood. Wire shafts are permitted. Hubs that allow blade replacement and/or manual pitch adjustment are allowed. Mechanisms that cause variable pitch and/or variable diameter of propellers while in flight shall not be allowed. (Natural flexing and flaring of wooden blades is allowed.)
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />The first thing to notice that the rules governing &quot;gadgets&quot; are written separately for each of these classes. There is no consistency in the language.
<br />
<br />19.2.11 may be interpreted to outlaw the use of sleeves for EZB, since a sleeve functions to prevent rubber knots, which specifically &quot;affects the rate of energy from the rubber motor...&quot;
<br />
<br />We could also interpret that a torque burner is not allowed in the EZB and LPP. But a torque burner is allowed in the Ministick, since its rules do not rule out &quot;gadgets&quot; and only specifically say that VP's are not allowed.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I use tubes for the same reason. Typically, the tube is relatively short compared to the total motor length. Also, the ID of the tube will affect how loosely or tightly it fits around the wound rubber. I doubt that it is an effective torque burner. To be effective it would need to somehow regulate the release of torque to a lower level that a fully wound motor without tubes. I think all they really do is help to prevent the knots from forming near the hooks &amp; they are sometimes not very reliable at doing that!
