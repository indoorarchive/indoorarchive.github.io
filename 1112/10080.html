Nick, 
<br />
I use tubes for the same reason. Typically, the tube is relatively short compared to the total motor length. Also, the ID of the tube will affect how loosely or tightly it fits around the wound rubber. I doubt that it is an effective torque burner. To be effective it would need to somehow regulate the release of torque to a lower level that a fully wound motor without tubes. I think all they really do is help to prevent the knots from forming near the hooks &amp; they are sometimes not very reliable at doing that!

<br />I use tubes on my Ministicks for high ceiling flights, but this thread got me thinking about what is really happening to the rubber when the tubes are used. When the motor is fully wound, the tubes are slid up the motor to the hoods on the model. The role of the tubes is to keep the knots from bunching on the hooks and wasting turns or stoping the prop. The tubes constrict the rubber so that it can not bunch on the hooks. I thinking that by constricting the rubber at the ends the tubes may be functioning as an unintentional torque burner. I think more testing is needed to know what is really going on.Then depending on what is happening we would need to clarify the rules to specifically allow or disallow tubing.

<br /><br />Nick,
<br />
There is nothing in the A6 rules that would prohibit the use of tubing sleeves (or O rings). I don't think there is anything in the Ministick rules that would prohibit them either since the tubes are not used to restrict torque. LLP rules state &quot; no gadgets of any kind are allowed on the airplane&quot;. I don't think a tube meets the definition of a gadget, but if it does then so would an &quot;O&quot; ring.  Someone might argue that it is not on the airplane it is on the motor.

<br /><br />Wire spacers, when used on a F1D are considered to be part of the model weight. As for O-rings, they are normally counted towards the rubber weight. However, they can be cut off the motor as needed after the flight to meet a maximum motor weight. 
<br />
<br /><br />I would personally define anything that stays affixed to the model as part of the model weight and anything that is not left on the model when the rubber is removed as part of the rubber weight. I would think the tubbing sleeves would fall into the same category as o-rings because they help handle the rubber. However, I could see an argument for calling them a structural element since they are a mechanism for preventing the rubber from bunching at the hooks.  
<br />
<br /><br />It will be interesting to hear what the list has to say because if tubing sleeves are ruled a rubber control mechanism then they would be illegal for Ministick, A-6 and LPP.
