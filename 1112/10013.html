Free Flighers around the world knew Warren Williams of Claremont, CA.
<br />
He participated in the US F1d Team Selection programs throughout the 70's-90's.  He flew at Santa Ana beginning in the late 1940's. Along with conventional models, he'd built everything else, indoor and outdoor ornithopters, fly-powered models, twin-pusher Wakefields...
<br />
<br />Warren was a member of the AMA Hall of Fame. He still holds the Cat I Limited Pennyplane record. His plan for a Rise-Off-Water microfilm model was published in a Zaic Yearbook.
<br />
<br />His building room was a time capsule of free flight history. He was amazingly generous and taught me how to pour microfilm one evening using a tank constructed on his kitchen table. 
<br />
<br />&quot;To all AMA friends of Warren J Williams Sr.
<br />
<br />I need to notify you of his passing just a few days after Thanksgiving.
<br />
<br />He reached the wonderful age of 97 years.
<br />
<br />I am his oldest son Warren Williams Jr. and where do I begin.
<br />
<br />I am not sure where to begin...
<br />
<br />Here is a short Biography, and a reminder of all the things he has accomplished and witnessed.
<br />
<br />Born in April 1914
<br />
<br />Attended and graduated from Sacramento State University with a degree in Engineering 1930's.
<br />
<br />Hired, and worked for Lockheed aircraft for 37 years. Lockheed sent him to work in London England from 1939 to 1945 to supervise, and to build aircraft for the war effort.
<br />
<br />Worked with Paul McCready on the wing formation of the Gossamer Albatross. 
<br />
<br />Met Howard Hughes in the 1950's. On the weekends (3-4 years) he supervised the Engine Maintenance on Howard's personal aircraft.  
<br />
<br />He held many AMA indoor rubber power records over the years. Currently still has one record open on the books.
<br />
<br />In 2006 he was voted into the AMA Hall of Fame. 
<br />
<br />Warren had three son's that he put through college. Each of them finished college with Master's Degree's. 
<br />
<br />One in Finance, One in Sociology, and One in Special Education.  
<br />
<br />Warren at the age of 14 to 15 met Charles Lindbergh at the Oakland airport after his historic Spirit of St. Louis flight.
<br />
<br />Lindbergh asked him if he was interested in airplanes. My fathers reply, &quot;Yes, sir.... That's all I can think about.&quot;
<br />
<br />Those words stayed with him all his life.&quot;
