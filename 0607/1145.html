A couple of weeks ago, I found the density of the air at Johnson City and Moscow.  Johnson City came out at 90.94% while Moscow was 92.31%--a mere 1.37% difference.  I took the data required from the national weather service's website.  
<br />
<br />So, the air density doesn't account for the differences in times given the two very different heights.  At Lakehurst however, I talked to Larry Coslick who said that the temperature difference in Moscow between the ceiling and floor was about .2 degrees.  This is quite odd seeing that the difference at Lakehurst is about 10 degrees.  Anyone who walks to the top of the bleachers at Johnson City can notice a difference in the temperature; thus, there must be some sort of difference between the floor and ceiling--at least .2 degrees.  I think that the Kibbie Dome is heated in some way to give an even temperature and that this is the reason for the comparable times even with the higher ceiling.

<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;11 duration rubber events had higher winning times at JC than at 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;KD. One duration rubber event (F1L) had higher KD winning time than 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;JC. UCLG and SCLG had slightly higher KD times.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The 11 rubber duration events with higher JC times had the following 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;% higher times, averaging out to 9% higher across these 11 events.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Intermediate Stick (12%)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;35cm (10%)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bostonian (27%)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;F1D (5.5%)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;AROG (4%)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;WS (7.6%)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministick (2.1%)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;EZB (4.8%)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;OPP (4.6%)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A6 (28%)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;LPP (3.3%)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The question, of course, is attribution. How much of the above is 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;attributable to better flyERS or better models versus better site 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and/or conditions? In many cases (A6, Bostonian) some difference is 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;obviously due to a modeler who specializes or excels in the event vs 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a flyers at KD who does not. IOW, more high level competition at JC 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;in a some events. In other cases, a few winning KD times probably 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;could have been higher had some multiple-event flyers needed to do 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;so. For example, in ministick, I landed with maybe 500(?) turns left 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;out of 4000. I could have shortened motor for another try, but the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;first flight held on for first place, so I didn't bother with a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;second flight. Similarly, in OPP, my second flight held on for 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;first, but I didn't get too near ceiling, and didn't bother to try 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;improve it. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;JC elevation is listed per Google as 1635 ft, and Moscow 2560 ft. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That's less than 1000 ft difference. Is altitude-density so 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;different within 1000 ft--enough to account for 9% difference? I 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;think temperature dispersion may explain more. KD contains so many 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;more cubic ft. that thermals and warmer layers disperse before 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;providing much benefit for very long. Of course, that's given an 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;indoor space which doesn't interact so much with outdoor weather, as 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;opposed to say, Lakehurst Hangar 1. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I think the bottom-beam height at JC is more easily pegged than 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;at KD due to ease of visibility and judgement about just where the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;model is. Consider how often we hear &quot;I only reached the curtain&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;at KD. (Often) Or how 'bout, &quot;I got close to ceiling tiles, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;but...&quot; (Often). This could very easily mean 10 or 15 ft below the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;tiles at KD, since it's hard to judge just how close you are unless 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;you walk to other end of building, and view from different angle. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, at KD, a flight all the way to the top is much more likely 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to be something risky (thanks to curtain wires) than a similar just-
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to-beams flight at JC. This discourages risk taking, except by the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;risk takers!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Take away the thermal gifts either site can offer, and I suppose 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;there would be about a minute difference between a good F1d flight at 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;JC vs. KD. That's only 3% difference.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;We really should remember to now n then send a thermometer up to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;ceiling with a balloon at both sites.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll be glad to do so at Kibbie 2007! (Provided we still have modern 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;civilization intact come July 2007.)
