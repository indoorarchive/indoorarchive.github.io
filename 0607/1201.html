Hey guys,
<br />
<br />Its been a while. School, work, and constantly moving between the two
<br />
have really kept me busy the past couple of years. I've still got lots
<br />
of indoor ideas kicking around that I need to try at some point. I'm
<br />
still following this forum among others. Anyways, I thought I might be
<br />
able to add some insight to this discussion... 
<br />
<br />For three and up equally spaced boron, the orientation doesn't matter.
<br />
Unless you don't want to space them evenly in order to tailor the
<br />
stiffness (which in my opinion is advantageous in most cases). For
<br />
example, with 4 boron it's probably more advantageous to put the boron
<br />
at 1,5,7,11 for an unbraced stick. That will give very good stiffness
<br />
in the plane of bending induced by the motor tension. It will also
<br />
give some stiffness in the perpendicular plane to prevent buckling,
<br />
but not as much. 
<br />
<br />The bending stiffness is proportional to the material stiffness
<br />
(young's modulus) and the area moment of inertia. For a rolled tube
<br />
fuselage, a majority of the bending stiffness comes from the boron
<br />
(assmuing it doesn't locally buckle away from the tube). You can
<br />
generally ignore the balsa in these calculations, since it has a few
<br />
orders of magnitudes lower young's modulus. The balsa tube is very
<br />
important when it comes to the torsional stiffness though, in which
<br />
case the boron does essentially nothing. The area moment of inertia
<br />
can be computed by taking the area of the boron cross section times
<br />
the distance from neutral axis squared. This is valid since the boron
<br />
is so compact and is away from the neutral axis. For a rectangle (say
<br />
a balsa spar) the area moment of inertia is 1/12*width*height^3. 
<br />
<br />Say the boron has an area of 1 unit squared, and the tube diameter is
<br />
10 units. Lets look at a couple examples. In each example the neutral
<br />
axis is perpendicular to the bending plane and passes through the
<br />
center of the tube.
<br />
<br />Boron at 12 and 6 o'clock:
<br />
Relative bending stiffness in plane of rubber bending = 1 unit^2 *(5
<br />
unit)^2 + 1 unit^2 * (5 unit)^2 = 50 unit^4
<br />
in the other plane, the boron is on the neutral axis, so it
<br />
contributes essentially no bending stiffness.
<br />
<br />Boron at 3,6,9,12:
<br />
Bending stiffness in the plane of rubber bending is unchanged since
<br />
the 3 and 9 o'clock boron are on its neutral axis.  == 50 unit^4
<br />
Similarly for bending in the perpendicular axis the 3 and 9 provide 50
<br />
unit^4 of stiffness and the 6 and 12 provide none.
<br />
<br />Now 3 boron spaced at 4,8,12:
<br />
Plane of rubber bending = 1 unit^2 * (5 unit)^2 + 1 unit^2*(5*sin(30
<br />
deg))^2 + 1 unit^2 *(5 unit*sin(30 deg))^2 = 25 + 25/4 + 25/4 = 37.5
<br />
unit^4
<br />
Perpendicular plane = 1 unit^2 * 0^2 + 1 unit* (5 unit*cos(30))^2 + 1
<br />
unit * (5 unit*cos(30))^2 = 37.5 unit^4
<br />
<br />4 boron at 1,5,7,11
<br />
Plane of rubber bending = 4 * 1 unit^2 *(5 unit*cos(30))^2 = 75 unit^4
<br />
perpendicular plane = 4 * 1 unit^2 * (5 unit*sin(30))^2 = 25 unit^4
<br />
<br />I hope this clears some stuff up, and doesn't confuse you all too
<br />
much. A diagram of some sort would probably helpful. It might be
<br />
worthwile to draw a circlular tube and the boron locations to try and
<br />
see how the calculations work, then they can be repeated for any boron
<br />
locations you want (for random locations, the neutral axis is
<br />
essentially the center of area of the boron fibers). 
<br />
<br />[Side note: This last point allows you to see why one boron fiber
<br />
doesn't work well at all. Its young's modulus is so high, that the
<br />
neutral axis moves very close to the fiber even when the effects of
<br />
the balsa tube are included. Then when computing the moment of inertia
<br />
the distance from the neutral axis to the fiber is very small, so you
<br />
get very little bending stiffness. Hence the huge jump in stiffness
<br />
from going from 1 boron to 2 or more.]
