11 duration rubber events had higher winning times at JC than at 
<br />
KD.   One duration rubber event (F1L) had higher KD winning time than 
<br />
JC.   UCLG and SCLG had slightly higher KD times.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The 11 rubber duration events with higher JC times had the following 
<br />
% higher times,  averaging out to 9% higher across these 11 events.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Intermediate Stick (12%)
<br />
35cm (10%)
<br />
Bostonian (27%)
<br />
F1D (5.5%)
<br />
AROG (4%)
<br />
WS (7.6%)
<br />
Ministick (2.1%)
<br />
EZB (4.8%)
<br />
OPP (4.6%)
<br />
A6 (28%)
<br />
LPP (3.3%)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The question, of course, is attribution.  How much of the above is 
<br />
attributable to better flyERS or better models versus better site 
<br />
and/or conditions?  In many cases (A6, Bostonian) some difference is 
<br />
obviously due to a modeler who specializes or excels in the event vs 
<br />
a flyers at KD who does not.  IOW, more high level competition at JC 
<br />
in a some events. In other cases, a few winning KD times probably 
<br />
could have been higher had some multiple-event flyers needed to do 
<br />
so.  For example, in ministick, I landed with maybe 500(?) turns left 
<br />
out of 4000.  I could have shortened motor for another try, but the 
<br />
first flight held on for first place, so I didn't bother with a 
<br />
second flight.  Similarly, in OPP, my second flight held on for 
<br />
first, but I didn't get too near ceiling, and didn't bother to try 
<br />
improve it.  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
JC elevation is listed per Google as 1635 ft, and Moscow 2560 ft.  
<br />
That's less than 1000 ft difference.  Is altitude-density so 
<br />
different within 1000 ft--enough to account for 9% difference?   I 
<br />
think temperature dispersion may explain more.  KD contains so many 
<br />
more cubic ft. that thermals and warmer layers disperse before 
<br />
providing much benefit for very long.  Of course, that's given an 
<br />
indoor space which doesn't interact so much with outdoor weather, as 
<br />
opposed to say, Lakehurst Hangar 1. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Also, I think the bottom-beam height at JC is more easily pegged than 
<br />
at KD due to ease of visibility and judgement about just where the 
<br />
model is.   Consider how often we hear &quot;I only reached the curtain&quot; 
<br />
at KD.  (Often)  Or how 'bout,  &quot;I got close to ceiling tiles, 
<br />
but...&quot; (Often).  This could very easily mean 10 or 15 ft below the 
<br />
tiles at KD, since it's hard to judge just how close you are unless 
<br />
you walk to other end of building, and view from different angle.   
<br />
Besides, at KD, a flight all the way to the top is much more likely 
<br />
to be something  risky (thanks to curtain wires) than a similar just-
<br />
to-beams flight at JC.  This discourages risk taking, except by the 
<br />
risk takers!
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Take away the thermal gifts either site can offer, and I suppose 
<br />
there would be about a minute difference between a good F1d flight at 
<br />
JC vs. KD.  That's only 3% difference.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
We really should remember to now n then send a thermometer up to 
<br />
ceiling with a balloon at both sites.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I'll be glad to do so at Kibbie 2007!  (Provided we still have modern 
<br />
civilization intact come July 2007.)
