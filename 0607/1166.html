<br />
This year I was fortunately able to attend both Johnson City and the Kibbie.  Here is my 
<br />
perspective by model for those models that I flew at both:
<br />
<br />35 cm:  JC time 23:40 (practice) - Kibbie time 25:46.  I used the same rubber size, but was 
<br />
able to wind to a higher torque level.  This torque level would have put me into the rafters 
<br />
at JC.
<br />
<br />Intermediate stick:  JC time 31:33 - Kibbie time 32:38.  The Kibbie time was with my 
<br />
never-flown backup as I broke a bracing wire on my primary plane.  Again I used the same 
<br />
rubber size at Kibbie but had to adjust the VP to do the above time.
<br />
<br />Unlimited Penny Plane:  JC time 16:45 - Kibbie time 16:23.  Again used same rubber size 
<br />
but had to adjust VP at Kibbie.  Would have had a 17+ flight at Kibbie, but the motor 
<br />
broke at 13 minutes with about 100 feet of altitude.
<br />
<br />Limited Penny Plane:  JC time 13:54 - Kibbie time 13:29.  Again same rubber size at 
<br />
Kibbie.  Last year I did a 14:31 at Kibbie (practice) with the same rubber size.  Would have 
<br />
had a similar time this year, but a know hung the prop and I lost about 50 feet before it 
<br />
broke free.  
<br />
<br />In general my impression was that I needed more torque and turns at Kibbie to get about 
<br />
the same times.   I don't know whether it was temperature, altirude, and/or humidity 
<br />
(much drier at Kibbie).    
<br />
<br />For those of you who have never been to Kibbie, you're missing the premier non-blimp-
<br />
hangar flying site in the country.  The contest is very laid back and you can fly what you 
<br />
want when you want.  The usable high-ceiling  flying area is easily twice that of JC and you 
<br />
don't have JC's scoreboard to worry about.  This year we flew light planes (F1D, 
<br />
Intermediate stick, and 35 cm at one end and the heavier duration stuff at the other end.   
<br />
At the same time the FAC scale guys were flying in the center section where there is also a 
<br />
scoreboard but it's sheathed in plastic to eliminate hang-ups.  
<br />
<br />I strongly encourage all indoor flyers to seriously consider going to Kibbie next year.  The 
<br />
dates are July 6 - 10.  As I understand it, the entry fees this year may not have covered the 
<br />
expense of renting the dome.   If this continues, then we indoor flyers will loose a fantastic 
<br />
flying site.  
<br />
<br />Finally a special thanks to Rob Romash and crew for running JC and Andrew Tagliafico for 
<br />
running Kibbie - GREAT JOB GUYS!!!
