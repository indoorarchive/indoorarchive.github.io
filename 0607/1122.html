A bit of what I remember...
<br />
<br />Sat morning I got there around 9, and Sanborn and Scheaffer were
<br />
already there as was Coslick...  Larry had everything organized for
<br />
the weekend, and ready to go...  Unfortunately, they were moving
<br />
things at the hanger, and the back door was open until around 1:30 or
<br />
so...  so no one was really doing much at that point, since drift was
<br />
really bad...  The regulars (Joe, Tom, Tony, and Karl) also showed up
<br />
late morning...  Tom I, Dave D, John K, and Max Z also were there... 
<br />
(sorry if I missed anyone...)
<br />
<br />The air was really &quot;blowy&quot; (think that was John's quote...) all day,
<br />
and drift was really bad...  Lot of PP and LPP flying, but even those
<br />
were getting blown all over the hanger...  (one nice part was that the
<br />
Air Force had the fenced-in area gate open, so at least you didn't
<br />
have to worry about that...)  Larry was flying F1L, and it seemed like
<br />
everyone had a HLS...  Tom, Tony, John, and Max all had the big guys
<br />
out at some point...  Pretty cool seeing all of those huge planes
<br />
flying at 25' on quarter motors...
<br />
<br />Sun wasn't really much better condition wise than Sat...  I know that
<br />
all of the times that I was there last year, there were no days that
<br />
drift was that bad...  With Larry's help though, I did manage to get a
<br />
personal best with EZB on Sun... but it went almost 3/4 the length of
<br />
the hangar during the flight...  and from one side to the other
<br />
also...  Unfortunately, on Sun night with it getting dark and even
<br />
worse, I made the mistake of sending it up one last time, and as I was
<br />
packing up my stuff, at about the top of the hanger, it moved about
<br />
100 ft in a few circles, and is now a fixture on the side wall on a
<br />
girder at the top...  
<br />
<br />I don't have the &quot;official&quot; result sheets, but Coslick did set a new
<br />
Cat IV F1L record, I think...  25:15 or thereabouts...  (forgot to
<br />
write everything down before I left...  we left the hanger on Sun
<br />
night at about 8:00, and it was completly dark, to the point that you
<br />
couldn't even really see the floor...  storm was going thru...)  He
<br />
also had a really high EZB flight (32+ ?) with his new .3g EZB...  I
<br />
seem to remember that there might have been another record in there
<br />
somewhere, or something close...  Kagan might have the results sheets,
<br />
since I think he stayed there thru Tuesday... 
<br />
<br />Kagan was flying the &quot;Moose&quot;, but on one of the early (if not the
<br />
first) full motor flight it came down with something like 6-7
<br />
breaks...  blew me away that he had it back in action in about an
<br />
hour...  It was almost in a ball, and he got it right back together...
<br />
&nbsp;There were some pretty decent LPP times, from what I remember... Max
<br />
seemed to be getting some good ones, but I don't know the times...
<br />
<br />Brett, Doug, John, Tom, and Max were going to be there on Mon and Tue,
<br />
I think, so maybe they know if anything exciting happened then...
<br />
<br />That's about all I can remember...
