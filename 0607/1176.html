--- In Indoor_Construction_at_yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tim Goldstein&quot; 
<br />
&lt;timg_at_...&gt; 
<br />
<br />Tim Goldstein writes, 
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;Mark B posted that anything goes on this list. What he seems to 
<br />
have really
<br />
meant was anything goes as long as it is not competition to his 
<br />
list.&gt;&gt;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Au contraire, Mr. Goldstein, I have  gladly cooperated with any 
<br />
person or group polite enough to let me know their desire to &quot;Link 
<br />
up&quot;  or to advertise on Indoor_Construction.  Please notice Jeff 
<br />
Hood's board was very early linked on Indoor_Const., and I never did 
<br />
request that he in turn &quot;link me.&quot;  Ditto with Kurt's Glider site 
<br />
(which I linked, and personally posted about, voluntarily) And 
<br />
others.  As far as I know, Indoor_Const. still isn't linked on 
<br />
Indoornews.com, or many other groups, and neither am I complaining.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Au Contraire #2, everyone.     I was a part of a brief email 
<br />
discussion involving Tim Goldstein, Tony Pavel, John Kagan, Mark 
<br />
Shaefer, Steve B, Carl B, and Nick A when the idea was floated by Tim 
<br />
Goldstein, referring to Indoor_Const.  &quot;Hey in order to prevent the 
<br />
kind of heavy-handedness that exists with present group, we need to 
<br />
have a web group that would be INAV SPONSORED.&quot;    
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I was glad to be a part of that email discussion, and commented the 
<br />
following to the above group, on April 23, 2006.  The following 
<br />
request was made AFTER I removed the Topic Rules, but regardless when 
<br />
this was  made, reasonable people may recognize this as not 
<br />
unreasonable, made by a human being.   I quote,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&lt;&lt;I don't mind reading about your guys' efforts to create &quot;a better&quot; 
<br />
(heh, heh) indoor group.  There is only one thing I would consider 
<br />
dastardly.  I built Indoor_Construction starting with my personal 
<br />
address book.  I did not lift from other lists looking for members, 
<br />
and did not even announce my effort on Yahoo Indoor--although it HAD 
<br />
promised (or threatened?)  to fold after a certain date, even in Nov. 
<br />
05. &gt;&gt;
<br />
&nbsp;[The important part...]
<br />
&nbsp;&lt;&lt;I *would only* be offended if any of you use the addresses found 
<br />
on Indoor Construction to promote your new, improved model, OR if you 
<br />
were to *post about* your organizational efforts on 
<br />
Indoor_Construction.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Group, I did delete Tony's post until I could be told whether or not 
<br />
the above new site was in line with (back by) the above &quot;Dump Bennett 
<br />
movement&quot; or not.  As it stands, the INAV site is not even a chat 
<br />
group.  But I *did* want to know about its intentions, from Tony, or 
<br />
whomever.   And if yes--meaning yes, to be expanded into indoor chat 
<br />
group started because INdoor_Construction was too &quot;heavy-handed&quot;--
<br />
then yes, I'm guilty as charged for not wanting to facilitate the 
<br />
success of Tim Goldstein's idea.  And that still stands.  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
But INAV is great.  Go join the site, everybody.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Tim continues,
<br />
&nbsp;&lt;&lt;It is bullshit like this &gt;&gt;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Oh, does my rebuke of your previously posted &quot;Manly Language&quot;  
<br />
account for some of your ire?  Or is it rather that I asked you to 
<br />
try to make arguments using only English, and not Rap?  Never mind, 
<br />
Tim, it appears *intimidation* is the language you know best, and use 
<br />
it with anyone who doesn't Kowtow to your indoor-supplier-power, such 
<br />
as threatening to not sell wood to those who you don't appove of.   
<br />
Such as, 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&lt;&lt; Maybe I will also cut some wood and then only sell
<br />
it to people that act like adults.&gt;&gt; TG  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Well, I'm sure I won't be your first previously labeled &quot;Good 
<br />
Customer&quot; who gets to hear,   &quot;!!NO SOUP FOR YOU!!&quot;  in a moment of 
<br />
your &quot;disapproval.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&lt;&lt;It is bullshit like this that is making me want to just follow Don 
<br />
S and fly
<br />
my helicopters in peace.&gt;&gt;TG.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Fly whatever makes you happy, Tim.   We're both advocates of free 
<br />
choice, eh?  But is your statement supposed to make some of us afraid 
<br />
and nervous that you will &quot;quit&quot; everything indoor?  As you know, 
<br />
supply and demand can usually find its own equilibrium--I'm not at 
<br />
all nervous about your plans, or threat. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&lt;&lt;This is not to be taken as a challenge to &quot;your&quot; group unless you 
<br />
are really
<br />
much less mature than I have come to expect of you.&gt;&gt;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Thank you Daddy.  Nice to know you had *previously* regarded me as a 
<br />
mature person--but wait--I can STILL measure up as a mature person in 
<br />
your eyes if I do the right thing.   Oh, right, and your  implied 
<br />
threat and invective was *not* really a challenge--it was just 
<br />
encouragement I guess.   So all is forgiven, brother Christian, and I 
<br />
now realize you are the example of maturity, and would *never* 
<br />
withhold selling indoor balsa to those who don't line up to you.   
<br />
LOL!
<br />
<br />Everyone else, sorry.  The important part is my first paragraph, 
<br />
above.
<br />
Sincerly,
<br />
Mark F1diddler
