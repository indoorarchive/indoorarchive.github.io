Hi Kurt, 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;That is a good point.  The LSF program has people who have run through the 5 levels more than once.  They also have an unofficial level 6, which is helping someone else achieve their level 5.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;If we do it right, the LIFA program could simultaneously provide consistent incentive for newcomers, as well as prestige and ongoing challenge for top performers.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I remember when you proposed the AKC model.  It is hard to believe 2 years have passed already!  Similarly, here is the first reference I could find for applying the LSF model to Indoor - back when I used to write a lot more on this list.  I think it all still applies:
<br />
&nbsp;

&nbsp;Fortunately you won't end up in the hospital if you crash and burn on 
<br />
&nbsp;your first &quot;high end&quot; model (although your ego may take a hit).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;As I'm fond of pointing out (mostly 'cause I like ribbing them), many 
<br />
&nbsp;of our top youngsters build first F1D's that were, to put is as 
<br />
&nbsp;nicely as I can, pieces of cr*p. But their second ones sure 
<br />
&nbsp;weren't. And before long these guys were at the top of the heap.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Doesn't mean we don't need beginner events though. We had a sidebar 
<br />
&nbsp;discussion on this a couple of months ago that evolved my opinion. 
<br />
&nbsp;Now I think a good beginner event is defined by:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;- Eliminating of some complexities (at the expense of extra rules). 
<br />
&nbsp;Make it a little easier to build decent model. Note that I didn't 
<br />
&nbsp;say &quot;easiest&quot;, since that is largely up for debate. Some people 
<br />
&nbsp;thing film covering is easy, others think tissue is easy, and a more 
<br />
&nbsp;than a few think microfilm is easy. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;- Accessibility. Contrary to some opinion, I think challenges are 
<br />
&nbsp;good and motivating for beginners. But accessible challenges. It's 
<br />
&nbsp;not too much fun to start with a design that calls for all kinds of 
<br />
&nbsp;hard to obtain materials (at least for a beginner).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;- An achievement goal that has nothing to do with the other people 
<br />
&nbsp;(aka experts) who might fly the event. This was my biggest 
<br />
&nbsp;revelation from that other discussion. My favorite proposal is 
<br />
&nbsp;modeled after R/C Soaring's League of Silent Flight program 
<br />
&nbsp;(www.silentflight.org). In that, you fulfill a defined set of tasks 
<br />
&nbsp;to work your way from LSF Level I to Level IV (Level I is pretty 
<br />
&nbsp;easy a relatively short slope / thermal flight and 3 spot landings -
<br />
&nbsp;but still a good beginner goal). In our case we might want to 
<br />
&nbsp;define something like a 5 minute LPP flight. Give out an achievement 
<br />
&nbsp;patch or stickers. The target stays the same regardless of &quot;expert&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;involvement and the beginners have something rewarding to shoot for.
