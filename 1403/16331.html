Hi John,
<br />
     I think this is a great idea, similar to a suggestion I posted a couple of years ago(I have copied the email below so you can think about other features the AKC system offers).   The big thing in my opinion is both concepts move the important from winning to achieving.   The one thing the AKC does which I suggest you try to incorporate in your LIFA is to never have a top level.  Basically I am suggesting you can be a Level 5(1), then if you achieve something in the Level 5 list again you would achieve a Level 5(2) etc(you probably can come up with a better naming system).   That allows even some one like you( with your esteem and long list of achievements) a future goal.  I am only suggesting this for Level 5.
<br />
 
<br />
Cheers,
<br />
Kurt

<br />Hi,
<br />
      With all this beginner vs expert discussion,  I just wanted to push out a general thought, something that I think the AMA needs to consider in regards to competition.  Recently I have been spending a lot of time training my dog and going to AKC dog competitions, specially Agility.  These are very popular, if I wanted to drive about 3 hours to a competition, I could probably find one every weekend of the year.  They are typically held in large buildings, at least Cat 2 or above sites.  If you don't sign up for an event a month ahead of time, you will not be able to attend, they fill up and typically limited the contestants to a  few hundred.  
<br />
     Now the AKC has set up the competition in a way that it is not important that you win or come in first, second or third, the importance is that you qualify or Q the event.    Three Q's gets you a title, basically a piece of paper, which doesn't have a lot of value, but has importance to the person that earn it.  There are different classes from Novice to Excellent and in the final class you earn MACH'S and you can earn an unlimited amount of MACHS.   MACH stand for Master Agility Champion which has slightly different rules than the other titles.  To get a Q you need to &quot;pass&quot; the event, perform the course with no or one small mistake and have a time that is reasonable.  A qualifying score is determined by the rules and is dependent on the agility course that day of the event.  The AKC keeps records of all of this and makes lots of money handing out pieces of paper.  An event is held by a local club which also makes a lot of
<br />
&nbsp;money.    As far as I can see everyone wins on the deal, because AKC gives the competitors a better chance of success, many competitors go home proud that they did well, being able to state that they qualified.   They still give out along with a ribbon for qualifying,.... first, second and third ribbons, but the importance is qualifying,
<br />
     I personally think if  AMA competition wants to move forward, get more people attending, a system like what the AKC setup should be considered.  
<br />
 
<br />
Just some thought I felt like sharing with others,
<br />
 
<br />
Kurt

Buxton, Romash, and I had a lot of time to think and talk on our way back from the EAA contest.  One topic was an Indoor FF incentive program modeled after soaring's LSF program. 
<br />
<br />The idea came up several years ago during one of the &quot;experts are ruining the beginner events&quot; discussion iterations.  The complaint was that new beginner events are easy for a beginner to win at first, but inevitably become harder as people figure them out.  With the incentive program, the achievement levels stay the same for each new participant.
<br />
<br /><br />Here is our outline.  As with LSF, we could maintain an online list, and award stickers for each achievement level (though, unlike LSF, the stickers would go on your toolbox, not your model).  Comments?
<br />

<br />
 
<br />
