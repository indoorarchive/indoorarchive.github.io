<br />
Hi, Group.
<br />
<br />I'm a new member.  I've built planes for half a century, and an AMA member
<br />
most of my adult life, but never built anything as light and delicate as
<br />
indoor FF models.  I hope some of you will take pity on a newbie and answer
<br />
some basic questions.  I was going to send them to Model Aviation's Indoor
<br />
columnist, Jon Kagan, but I see the January column was his last....
<br />
<br />I recently tried to assemble a Parlor Mite from a kit I'd been storing for
<br />
20 years or more.  This was my first experience with sliced ribs.  They
<br />
worked better than I expected.  The stripwood cutter described in the
<br />
instructions worked pretty well, too.  It was made from part of a single
<br />
edge razor blade and some wood for a base and spacers.
<br />
<br />Then I got into trouble.  My first assemblies broke when I tried to lift
<br />
them from wax paper.  I'd used small amounts of wood glue.  I finally got
<br />
that solved by using parchment paper instead of wax paper.  My next wing
<br />
and tail parts came off the paper fine.  But, the wing has quite a twist in
<br />
it.  The twist may be from tension in the glue joints, or perhaps clamping
<br />
the LE and TE to the building board twisted them, then they sprang back
<br />
when released.
<br />
<br />So, what are the better choices for glues?
<br />
<br />How are you building these models without a lot of warps?
<br />
<br />The instructions mention adding warps to help hold up the left wing against
<br />
motor torque, but not how to add them.  My assumption is that if I knew how
<br />
to add them, I'd also be able to remove them.  So, how is that done?
<br />
Wetting the wood seems likely to make things worse.  Steaming the structure
<br />
may work before it's covered, but not after the tissue is added.  Dry heat
<br />
could soften the lignen in the wood and let it take a new form, but how
<br />
would that work after covering with condenser paper?
<br />
<br />How do you secure the covering to the frame?  Wouldn't even thinned dope
<br />
add a lot of weight?  How could it be applied to the top surface of a 1/32
<br />
square wood leading or trailing edge spar or 1/64 thick sliced rib and not
<br />
have it end up on at least three sides?  It seems to me I read something
<br />
about using thinned glue stick adhesive in a past issue, but don't know
<br />
where to find the info again, am not sure it was glue stick adhesive, and
<br />
don't recall what thinner was used.   :--O
<br />
<br />Other simple problems seem hard to answer.  How to pick up, position, and
<br />
steady ribs while the glue is applied and until it's dried is puzzling me.
<br />
I tried using little blocks to hold the ribs in place, but they moved
<br />
around.  I kept breaking the ribs when I picked them up, whether with my
<br />
fingers, electronics pliers, or dental tweezers.
<br />
<br />So, you can tell I have some problems with the basic processes.  Any
<br />
guidance will be greatly appreciated!  As an aside, I think basic
<br />
construction methods would be very useful now and then in an indoor column
<br />
or other publication.  The info is probably out there already, but I don't
<br />
know where to look.  Can you please at least point me toward the &quot;library&quot;?
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />
<br />Don Weigt, Madison, WI
