The A-6 event is NOT listed in the front of the AMA Rules in what appears to
<br />
be a table of contents of sort.  All of the other events seem to be listed
<br />
with references to the appropriate section further in the rule book.  There
<br />
is a however a reference to Mini-Stick, though I was not at the time looking
<br />
for it
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />So when I went to the AMA rules, being the A-6 event was not listed in the
<br />
table of contents,  I did not find them
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Thanks for letting me know they are indeed there
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Somebody needs to add A-6 to the table of contents section!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Looks to me like the following words need to be appended to para 4 Indoor
<br />
Rubber:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />A-6-- see section 26
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />It also looks like the event number (222) should be added to at the
<br />
beginning of the section where all others event numbers are listed!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />It appears that when A-6 was added in section 26, whoever did so did not
<br />
bring it forward to the listing of event numbers and table of contents of
<br />
sort
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Anywhio, I found them
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Thanks

<br />Where are the rules for the A-6 event located?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I do not see them as part of the official AMA rules, so I assume they are
<br />
some sort of unofficial event?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />My search of net did not turn them up anywhere!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Perhaps they are tucked away somewhere that I have not found?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Can someone point me to them, please
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />For that matter, where are the rules for mini-stick? 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Perhaps these too are in that same place that is eluding me?
<br />

Subject: [Indoor_Construction] Help requested by beginning A6 fliers
<br />

<br />
<br />My son and I fly with the DC Maxecuters. We built an A6 Eenvoudige Zes
<br />
and have flown it at our contests at the National Building Museum in
<br />
Washington D.C., Cole Field House at the University of Maryland, and under a
<br />
47 foot ceiling at a community college. 
<br />
<br />We are getting flights in the 5 minute and 30 second range. We are using
<br />
.048 rubber, about a 12 inch loop, carrying 2500 winds. 
<br />
<br />We wondered what we should look at next to try to get to the seven minute
<br />
mark. Our props are oval, and we have them centered on the spar. We have
<br />
been set at 45 degrees. Would going to 60 degrees get us more efficiency and
<br />
longer times?
<br />
<br />Any help would be appreciated. We dream of the 10 minute flight.
<br />
