John is pretty much right on with his comments.  However, there are two systematic factors that can put newer fliers, even those you have mastered the skills needed to compete at the higher levels, at a disadvantage.  
<br />
<br />For those classes that have no minimum weight and even to some extent A6, the availability of the very lightest but strong wood is limiting.    This also applies to some other materials such as the Y2K2 film and the lightest condenser paper.  With effort and/or money, though, good wood can be found.
<br />
<br />But the most limiting factor is availability of the better batches of Tan II rubber.  As one gains the skill to build, trim, and wind well, having good rubber is the last step needed to be competitive (able to win or set records) with the experts.  Some of the fliers newer to this sport have found the limited supplies of good Tan II rubber needed to win competitions and set records (again with some cost). But, I for one hope that some day the newer Tan SS rubber will match the then current properties of the best Tan II batches.  This will do much to level the flying field.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a recurring topic.  Probably the 6th time around or so, that I've seen.  Bob knows, Mike and Josh might not have seen the previous discussions.  Search the old messages if you are interested.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll say the same thing I say each time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The challenge of our activity is to coax the most performance out of an airplane, within a certain set of rules.  It should be no surprise that people figure out what works and that the times go up.  You can call it a &quot;virus&quot;, but it is really just people being successful in what they set out to do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Similarly, there can be a perception that experts ruin the &quot;beginner classes&quot;, but an expert is simply someone who does well, and doing well is the whole point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lastly, different events highlight different building techniques and materials.  Any event can be built simply.  Every event can get tricky if you want to win.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An event where beginners can always be competitive with experienced fliers, is folly.  By the very definition, if there is any experience to be gained, then those who have gained it will do better than those who haven't.  The only way would be to reduce it to a simple game of chance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An event where &quot;experts&quot; are banned is a paradox.  Beginners become experts.  Rule: &quot;you can fly this event, but you can never do well in it.  If you do, you can't fly it&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An event that is &quot;easy for beginners to build&quot; is simply a projection of the rule-maker.  Some people think covering with tissue is easier than with film &#x2013; likely people who know how to cover with tissue.  Some people think covering with film is easier than tissue &#x2013; likely people who know how to cover with film.  Some people think solid motorsticks are easier than tubes &#x2013; likely people who know how to tune a solid stick by sanding in flex.  Some people think tube motorsticks are easier than solid ones &#x2013; likely people who know how to roll a tube.  Some people think that fixed pitch props are easier &#x2013; likely people who know how to make a good flaring fixed pitch prop.  Some people think VP's are easier &#x2013; likely people who know how to make and adjust a VP.  About the only thing universally true is that heavier models require less finesse than lighter ones.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are, however, actual ways to bring newcomers into the fold.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Example 1: the Pro/Am.  Give beginners a boost.  They get to experience the fun of Indoor FF without first having to overcome the barriers to entry.  Once they have a feel for what is involved, and have the first-hand thrill of seeing their plane in the air, they are hopefully better prepared to continue on their own.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Example 2: the LSF model of achievement levels.  A fixed set of achievement criteria that stay the same for each beginner, but give a sense of accomplishment for reaching a goal.  Level 1 could be: fly 5 minutes indoors with any model.  Perform the task in front of the required witnesses, send in a form, and get your name on an online list with a patch or a sticker to advertise your greatness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Examply 3: simply expose people to what we do.  Nobody I know that flies Indoor FF does so because it was easy.  They were attracted by the beauty and grace, and by the challenge.  Everybody thinks that Indoor FF is cool.  A small slice has the interest, aptitude, and motivation to participate.
