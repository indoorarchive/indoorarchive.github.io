The Limited Penny Plane record is 12:53, set by 2-time LPP national champion Jim Richmond at Kent in 2007.  3-time LPP national champion, Tom Sova, is always a threat.  Bill Gowen and Leo Pilachowski both have very good low-ceiling LPP's.  They have a good opportunity this year.  Perhaps reigning LPP national champion Tom Iacobellis will make an appearance at Kent.  It would also good to see former LPP national champion, Walt Van Gorder, at Kent.
<br />
<br />Don S. has his eyes on the Cat II Cabin record, set 25 years ago by William Shailor.  Don has the Senior record.  The records were set on the same day, 7/13/87.  Don, what was the venue?
<br />
<br />Leo Pilachowski won the F1L event at Kent last year, but no one remembers.  He comes to Kent this year with a chip on his shoulder the size of the state of Indiana.  May Kent be even better for him this year.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you haven't heard, there's more good news from Kent.  Additional time will be available for flying on Saturday, 4/14, from 4 pm to 10 pm.  This will be held as a record trial.  The cost will be $10 per person per hour.  This news is especially good for out of town fliers, who now can enjoy this world class site for two days.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kent is where most of the AMA Cat II records have been set; more are sure fall this year with the two days.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are a number of interesting challenges and &quot;matches&quot; this year.  I will get the pot stirring ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The A6 battle continues at Kent.  Bill Gowen, current Cat I, II, and IV A6 record holder and 2007 USIC champion, faces a daunting group of A6 challengers.  Multi-time USIC A6 champion, Tom Sova, will defend his local turf against the outsiders.  Tom tells me that he has built a special A6 just for Kent.  I can't wait to see it.   Then there are the Kansas City A6 specialists: Gary Hodson, Tem Johnson, and Emil Schutzel.  Each of these gentlemen have a USIC A6 belt under him.  Gary narrowly lost to Bill at Tustin in Decmeber and is sure to be keen for a second battle.  These five gents -- Bill, Tom, Gary, Tem, and Emil -- together represent all of the USIC A6 winners.  Don't miss this rare opportunity to witness these gents fly against each other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; John Kagan will be looking to get back his Cat II F1D record.  In his path will be the current Cat II F1D record holder, Mark Bennett, and the current Cat IV F1D record holder Brett Sanborn.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Speaking of Kagan, does everyone remember that he broke the Cat II SCLG record last year?  He took that record from none other than Mr. Jim Buxton.  I hope Jim is ready to re-take his record; if not, he will have to start flying F1D to regain his honor.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another record that is on the line is F1L.  The current record is held by Larry Coslick at 16:06.  Last year, this writer broke this mark with a late flight of 16:23.  However, there was a &quot;small&quot; problem: the model weighed 1.17g instead of the minimum 1.20g.  Thoroughly embarrassed and disappointed, he vowed to return this year and break the mark again with a 1.20000g model.  Will the extra 30 mg hold him back?  We will see.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; More observations later...

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; From Don Slusarczyk (I'll post the flyer in the files section):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I am pleased to announce that The Cleveland Free flight Society will be hosting the 2012 Kent State Indoor Contest and Record Trials on Sunday April 15th, 2012. The Kent State Fieldhouse is an AMA CAT II site and has had many AMA indoor records set there over the years.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The contest portion will be flown from 8 am until 4:15 pm. Dedicated record trial will be flown until the facility closes at 10pm however we MUST be out of the building by 10PM so please no 9:59pm launches because at 10:01 the light go out.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The entry fee for the contest is $30 for open members and $3 for juniors. AMA membership is required.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Those wishing to stay the extended hours will be required to pay approximately an additional $20 as the extended hours must be paid for separately by me. Last year we had about 10 people each at $20 and that covered the extra $200 needed for the extended flying time. So the more who stay the less cost per person it will be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Please note some changes to the contest schedule. A-6 is now a contest event this year and No-cal is flown with no weight limit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If you have any question on the extended hours you can email me at don_at_ also if you are intending to stay the extended hours an email heads up would be nice so I can get an approximate head count.
