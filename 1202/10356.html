<br /><br /><br />Gary I'm not sure what you are trying to argue. That the current AMA  A-6

rules allow unlimited sized stabs? I agree, they do.

<br /><br />Can you make a rational argument for the current rules in light of  the

poll results where 71% of respondents preferred a 50% stab  limit?
<br />
<br /><br />You werent around back in the early 80s when Easy B started out this  way,

Don,
<br />
There you go again! Some revisionist history there.
<br />
Rule 26.3 reads, &quot;There is not restriction on the stabilizer area.&quot;  What 
<br />
part of that is vaguely written?
<br />
The indoor contest board, after  careful consideration, selected our 
<br />
counter proposal for the A6  rules. The reasons have been thoroughly discussed on 
<br />
this forum.

Gary is correct.  Bill Gowen’s A-6 design is not illegal, nor has it ever 
<br />
been. The very  vaguely written AMA A-6 rules say nothing about stab  area.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Some  background: The A-6 rules as originally presented to the Indoor 
<br />
Contest  Board in 2010 were very carefully written to outlaw gadgets and set the  
<br />
stab limit at 50% based on some careful polling that I did seeing where  
<br />
flyers stood on the issue. The polling revealed that 71% percent  preferred 
<br />
the 50% stab limit, so the mandate was clear and the proposal  was submitted 
<br />
and voted on. After initially supporting this proposal the  ICB changed their 
<br />
tune and contravened the wishes of the 71%, voting  10-1 in favor of the 
<br />
old, loopholed A-6 rules. So now we have an  official AMA A-6 rules where:
<br />
--biplanes are  legal
<br />
--tandems are  legal
<br />
--VP props are  legal
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
An interesting  sidenote: the District V Indoor Contest Board Rep is none 
<br />
other than  Bill Gowen! Bill was the only member of the board to stay 
<br />
consistent in  his voting against tandems, so don’t blame him for this debacle. The 
<br />
&nbsp;blame rests with the other 10 members of the Contest Board who chickened  
<br />
out and went back to the old, loopholed A-6 rules
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The A-6 rules  need a major rewrite, or the event may go the way of Easy B. 
<br />
I hope I’m  wrong.

The A6 rules  that were adopted by the AMA did not in any material way 
<br />
change the  previously existing  A6 rules as flown at the USIC for any years.  
<br />
Bill's plane was legal before &amp; it is still legal. If you  are referring to 
<br />
some local set of rules then that maybe a  different story.

Mike, to echo  Gary, 5 minutes is a very good duration time for A6. And, as 
<br />
far as a  10-minutes goal is concerned, my goal is 11-minutes, and has been 
<br />
for  several years. I know these little beasts can do that time.
<br />
<br />I am  not familiar with &quot;Een Voudige Zes&quot;. However, the translation of A6 
<br />
into  the AMA 2011-2012 rules has changed the design and building potential 
<br />
of  this model significantly. 
<br />
<br />You should try to look for plans  created after 2007. Bill Gowen, and Gary 
<br />
both have competitive models. I  want to say that their mastery of 
<br />
propeller/motor combinations is the  defining difference in duration. However, from 
<br />
what I find, Bill has  taken advantage of the new rules for A6 and has 
<br />
discussed his model on  this and other forums. I have found good information (and 
<br />
added my own  observations) on Hip Pocket Builder's Forum. 
<br />
<br />Good  flying,
<br />
