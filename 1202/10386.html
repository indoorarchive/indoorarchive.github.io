John,
<br />
Thanks for all you have done to assure the continuation of the Kibbie Dome event &amp; for keeping us informed. 
<br />
We need to know where to send our entry fees &amp;/or donations and who to make the check out to. 
<br />

Subject: [Indoor_Construction] Kibbie Dome Annual 2012 - update
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />The response for Kibbie 2012 looks good so far.
<br />
<br />I have a copy of the contract in front of me. Andrew Tagliafico and I are going to co-sign it. The event requires $6,000. Neither of us is going to lose money on this. Here's how it is going to work:
<br />
<br />July 6th-10th (the only timeslot available). Pre-registration. $200 for 5 days, including a table and two chairs. We are still deciding the fee for Juniors (Andrew's initial thought was $125, but the new thinking is that it should be less  that we should invest in these future participants, and encourage families to attend  while still paying the bills).
<br />
<br />Larry Coslick has been negotiating donations to help the cause. He is also arranging a NFFS accountant to manage the funds, so you don't have to worry about someone running off to Mexico with the cash.
<br />
<br />I plan to make one of those donation thermometer graphics to show where we stand. Entry fees will be in one color, donations another. My hope is to make this a self-sustaining event that can support itself year after year, so recurring revenue like entry fees are important.
<br />
<br />If we don't have enough money by June 1st, the event is cancelled and everyone gets his or her money back. Let's not let this happen. The cancellation portion of the contract says we forfeit our deposit, but they aren't requiring a deposit. This is largely because Andrew has never cancelled an event. Starting now would not be good for our future.
<br />
<br />Any funds beyond $6,000 will be held for future Kibbie events.
<br />
<br />A late fee of $40 will apply after May 25th (must be postmarked May 25th or earlier). 
<br />
<br />Onsite registration will be allowed, but obviously only if we reach our goal on June 1st.
<br />
<br />Cancellation refunds *may* be available for exceptional circumstances, but this is not guaranteed, and definitely not if it drops the funds below the required $6,000.
<br />
<br />Entry forms to be created shortly.
<br />
<br />I suggest that someone put together a raffle. The one at Johnson City has generated significant funds. Participants can bring stuff, and our cottage industry vendors may be coaxed to make donations (make sure to thank them and promote them as much as you can, or it might be the last donation they give you).
<br />
<br />I also suggest that someone coordinate collecting funds and renting a helium tank from a local party supply store, or a welding supply place (the welding supply will probably deliver, the party supply store will likely require a pick-up, but picking up a tank isn't difficult).
<br />
<br />I will not be able to attend this year. Others will need to coordinate the contest operations  processing, scoring, etc.
<br />
<br />What else? Am I missing anything?
<br />
