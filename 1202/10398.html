Having discussed this with many folks over the years...the &quot;competition  
<br />
creep.&quot;  Entry level competition is kind of a bugaboo for a lot of  us.  I 
<br />
really do not fly indoor more than a few times a year...and then  it's flying 
<br />
in awe of the Kang's, Gowen's, Romash's, kagan's, etc.  I love  it, but again 
<br />
it's only a few times a year...I always settle for 4th or 5th  depending on 
<br />
there being 4 or 5 of those guys flying.  It's magic to  me...but it's not 
<br />
that I may not just have the skills...it's more of it being a  part time 
<br />
thing.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I show up with my first attempts and then ask a ton of questions, but then  
<br />
again...I also try to fly a LOT of other FF events throughout the year...I 
<br />
am  not just dedicated to Indoor.  Having the Pro-Am thing is a great  
<br />
idea...and again...I can't make them every time...I'm not that dedicated.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The key sentence that Kang made...it's not too late to grab this one...just 
<br />
&nbsp;a nomenclature change.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;EZB became too hard for  most when models needed to weigh 0.5g or less to 
<br />
be competitive. The minimum  weight 'equalizer' was not instituted and hence 
<br />
the  competitors became a small group. In my opinion, adding a  minimum 
<br />
weight requirement to a class is the single best way to level the  playing 
<br />
field. But, anyway, that didn't happen in EZB.&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
Penny is the role model...Pennyplane and then &quot;Unlimited Pennyplane.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Can a similar thing be done with EZB...&quot;Unlimited B&quot;...A6...&quot;Unlimited  6?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Yeah...the records would have to be retitled, but that seems like paperwork 
<br />
&nbsp;to me.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Start, and then aspire to greatness.

<br />
Speaking as one who flew his first  Easy B back in early 1964 at the 
<br />
Madison Street armory in Chicago with  Charlie Sotich and other Aer onuts 
<br />
(hey-where were the rest of you? ;-)),  &quot;adding a minimum weight requirement&quot; would 
<br />
have kept Easy B from becoming  the tiny niche event for experts that it 
<br />
has. Back then an 11 minute  flight with a condenser paper covered Easy B would 
<br />
win a contest at the  armory. Has anyone seriously considered a second 
<br />
category of Easy B  with a weight rule? I doubt it. 30 minute flights with these 
<br />
models are  fantastic, but are such long flights by a literal handful of  
<br />
experienced fliers with the rare skill to build and trim a model that  
<br />
weights less than half a gram contributing to the overall lure of  indoor flying? 
<br />
Yes, there's limited penny plane. But should that be all,  particularly if 
<br />
we're trying to lure newcomers into the  hobby?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Before stepping down from the  podium, allow me to cite another quote, this 
<br />
one involving another indoor  event- Bostonian-&amp;nbs p;that has stagnated 
<br />
rather like Easy B  and all but died on the proverbial vine (yes, I've flown 
<br />
this one too,  starting at West Baden around 1980 when the event was in its  
<br />
infancy):
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;Intent of rule: This is an event to  promote indoor flying of 
<br />
rubber-powered models of a size an complexity which  are suitable for small buildings 
<br />
and limited skills. It also allows fanciful  designs, for which no full-size 
<br />
counterpart exists, to be  flown.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Really? For at least the past decade  or more this event has been owned by 
<br />
the look-alike &quot;flying flounder&quot;  lifting body models. These models may have 
<br />
originally been &quot;fanciful  designs&quot; but quickly became a fleet of boring 
<br />
clones. They most certainly  don't look much like &quot;realistic propeller-driven&quot; 
<br />
airplanes. As for  being &quot; suitable for limited skills,&quot; please- tell me 
<br />
another  one. The late Bob Meuser submitted several rules change proposals 
<br />
some  years back, one to require the Bostonian fuselage to be built with the  
<br />
required rectangular cross section to be in the vertical position. This  
<br />
would have eliminated the flounders and perhaps taken the even back to the  time 
<br />
when its models were truly fanciful and much more interesting in  
<br />
appearance. He also proposed a heavier weight minimum. Both proposals were  shot down 
<br />
by the indoor contest board at the time. Perhaps ICB member Larry  Coslick, 
<br />
if he reads this, can explain this matter  further.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Try rationally changing the rules of  a given indoor event such as Easy B 
<br />
or Bostonian that is dominated by  experienced fliers, some of whom sit on 
<br />
the ICB. Good luck. When Kang said  &quot;anyway, that (minimum weight notion) 
<br />
didn't happen in EZB .  Hmm...
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
In the meantime, here's to the  status quo!
