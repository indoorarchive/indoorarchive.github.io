Gary is correct. Bill Gowen's A-6 design is not illegal, nor has it ever
<br />
been. The very vaguely written AMA A-6 rules say nothing about stab area.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Some background: The A-6 rules as originally presented to the Indoor Contest
<br />
Board in 2010 were very carefully written to outlaw gadgets and set the stab
<br />
limit at 50% based on some careful polling that I did seeing where flyers
<br />
stood on the issue. The polling revealed that 71% percent preferred the 50%
<br />
stab limit, so the mandate was clear and the proposal was submitted and
<br />
voted on. After initially supporting this proposal the ICB changed their
<br />
tune and contravened the wishes of the 71%, voting 10-1 in favor of the old,
<br />
loopholed A-6 rules. So now we have an official AMA A-6 rules where:
<br />
<br />--biplanes are legal
<br />
<br />--tandems are legal
<br />
<br />--VP props are legal
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />An interesting sidenote: the District V Indoor Contest Board Rep is none
<br />
other than Bill Gowen! Bill was the only member of the board to stay
<br />
consistent in his voting against tandems, so don't blame him for this
<br />
debacle. The blame rests with the other 10 members of the Contest Board who
<br />
chickened out and went back to the old, loopholed A-6 rules
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />The A-6 rules need a major rewrite, or the event may go the way of Easy B. I
<br />
hope I'm wrong.

<br />The A6 rules that were adopted by the AMA did not in any material way change
<br />
the previously existing  A6 rules as flown at the USIC for any years. Bill's
<br />
plane was legal before &amp; it is still legal. If you are referring to some
<br />
local set of rules then that maybe a different story.

<br />Mike, to echo Gary, 5 minutes is a very good duration time for A6. And, as
<br />
far as a 10-minutes goal is concerned, my goal is 11-minutes, and has been
<br />
for several years. I know these little beasts can do that time.
<br />
<br />I am not familiar with &quot;Een Voudige Zes&quot;. However, the translation of A6
<br />
into the AMA 2011-2012 rules has changed the design and building potential
<br />
of this model significantly. 
<br />
<br />You should try to look for plans created after 2007. Bill Gowen, and Gary
<br />
both have competitive models. I want to say that their mastery of
<br />
propeller/motor combinations is the defining difference in duration.
<br />
However, from what I find, Bill has taken advantage of the new rules for A6
<br />
and has discussed his model on this and other forums. I have found good
<br />
information (and added my own observations) on Hip Pocket Builder's Forum. 
<br />
<br />Good flying,
