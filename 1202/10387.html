Props with the blade on one side of the spar are intended to flair (increase pitch &amp; slow the prop down) during the high torque portion of the flight thus limiting the climb &amp; extending the length of the flight. Like a variable pitch prop mechanism. Especially useful in, but not limited to, lower ceiling sites.
<br />
You said your plane &quot;dethermalized&quot; about 20' up at Lakehurst. I assume you mean it simply ran out of enough energy to continue to climb. You apparently need a larger cross section &amp;/or longer motor. Are you winding up close to the maximum torque for that motor when flying in Lakehurst? Based upon the times you are already getting &amp; your description of the bending motor stick, I would suggest that you need to build an A6 motor stick that can handle the torque better.
<br />
You never answered the question &quot;How much does your A6 weigh?&quot; 
<br />
I use plastic straws for the tubes on my motors. They are available in many diameters &amp; I pick them up everywhere I go. I cut them about 1/4&quot;-3/8&quot; long. I also use a hard plastic &quot;O&quot; ring on the front of the motor. Weather the &quot;O&quot; ring is metal or plastic should have nothing to do with whether or not it is included in the plane weight.

<br /><br />Many thanks to everyone who answered. There are actually some photos of our A6 at the National Building Museum under Fuller's photos NBM 2012. I'd appreciate anyone who might take a look particularly at our prop which is very conventional in design. We've had a chance to fly with a member of the US national team in F1. On his Penny Planes he uses props with the blade all on one side of the spar. Can anyone direct us to a reference on the benefits of this prop design? The photos of Bill Gowen's A6 show a similar arrangement.
<br />
<br />My son and I understand the controversy over A6 design. But we are really only competing against ourselves. We flew 5 minutes and 30 seconds at the windswept National Building Museum, and ditto at dusty Lakehurst where we dethermalized about 20 feet up. We'd like to go to 6 minutes.... So, its nice to know that we should head towards longer motors. Our most recent A6 built out of an IMS kit suffered from too flexible a motor stick, wound to higher torque the plane would circle right before left and wound up getting stuck in some embarrasing places.
<br />
<br />Is plastic tubing for the motor better than rubber heat shrink tubing for preventing motor climbing/knotting? Can anyone cite a source for us for plastic tubing for the motor ends? (And we won't even get into the controversy over whether the o rings should count as plane weight, or whether only metallic o rings count as plane weight....).
