The pizza party worked great for me - hardly any time off from flying and I didn't have to leave the building. I think this is a great idea for USI.... er... the Indoor Nats. (change is sometimes hard Randy)
<br />
<br />How about for Saturday night? We could charge a buck or two more than the cost of the pizza and add any profit to the raffle money.

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought our pizza party idea went over really well at the PPCC/Colorado Springs. Why not do that one night at USIC? 
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outdoor Nats we have the Thursday night NFFS cookout and raffle. The same idea could work at USIC.

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I like all parts of your plan except the (ugh) banquet. I missed several opportunities to go out with friends due to extreme fatigue. When you fly until 10:00 at night or later there's not much left in the tank for socializing.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I especially like the effort to make the contest friendlier for glider fliers. (can you make the BBB go away?)

<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don D, Let's start with the part where we do agree: 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- We want more people participating in Indoor FF, especially contests like USIC where the facility rental depends on having enough people to cover the cost. Whether or not the &quot;future of Indoor FF&quot; depends on increased numbers, it is certainly more fun with more people involved.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to think of a good way to discuss and evaluate our various &quot;plans&quot; for growing participation, and the best that I've come up with is for us to start with a separate thread for each plan. It is going to get messy, there will be overlap, and the separate threads will surely start to merge.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, based on past experience here, and in other communities, we won't reach an agreement on all - or probably even any - of the issues. But I think the exercise will be valuable to the people who choose to take on the challenge, forge ahead, and make change in a benevolent dictatorship kind of way.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW - since I'm presenting my own plan, I am going to feel warranted to say what I think is wrong with parts of the other plans.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;Kagan&quot; plan:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Continued effort on the &quot;three ingredients&quot;:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Make information available - so newcomers can get themselves going (Internet, youtube, magazines, books, TV, etc.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Obtain and retain flying sites - requires a special sales-guy personality (the &quot;Places to fly&quot; ingredient)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Develop local critical-mass groups - requires a special leader personality (the &quot;People to fly with&quot; ingredient)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Give newcomers a feeling of accomplishment to keep them hooked. Specifically: a 5 and 10-minute medal/award/certificate for achieving a 5 and 10 minute flight with any model.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Make USIC back into an event-of-the-year
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Tune up the schedule to, for example, encourage the glider guys to invest in the trip (I'm working on that now)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Keep a site record list and make it prestigious (Cat IV AMA records are not likely at ETSU)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Banquet? (ugh.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Think of other reasons to make people *want* to come (not feel like they have to)
<br />
