Earl Hoffman passed away last month in Santa Rosa, California. The  
<br />
following was written by his friend Ed Solenberger.
<br />
<br />Earl Hoffman 1912-2009
<br />
Earl Grew up in Detroit and spent much of his younger years in  
<br />
several interesting activities. One of which was Ice Boat Racing. He  
<br />
had a narrow escape when his boat plunged through the ice. He was  
<br />
rescued from what would have been death by freezing. He had many  
<br />
other stories to tell.
<br />
During WW2, he served the Government as a meteorologist. He was  
<br />
stationed in the area of Devil's Lake in North Dakota until the end  
<br />
of the war.
<br />
Earl was very active model flying, both outdoor and later indoor. He  
<br />
set several records and is one of less than 100 people, worldwide,  
<br />
who flew over 40 minutes. There have been flights of 1 hour, but very  
<br />
few! Most of these flights were done in very high ceilings, some in  
<br />
foreign countries.
<br />
Earl has four sisters and a son, plus a number of grandchildren, of  
<br />
whom he was very proud.
<br />
<br />Ed Solenberger - Santa Rosa
<br />
<br /><br />I have a couple of highlights of Earl's career to share. In 1988, 75  
<br />
year old Earl drove by himself to the Nationals at  East Tennessee  
<br />
State and won both EZB and Intermediate Stick. To top off this feat,  
<br />
in September of that year at Santa Ana, he flew to a new Int. Stick  
<br />
record of 31:19. This design, which he called the &quot;Symphony&quot; was then  
<br />
named indoor model of the year in 1989 and the plans of which are  
<br />
featured in all the plans books.
<br />
After Moffett Field was closed to indoor (and everything else),  
<br />
Earl's daughter began driving him to Moscow, Idaho for the annual  
<br />
Kibbee Dome Meet where on into his 90's he had a wonderful time  
<br />
competing. One year, now into his 90&quot;s, Earl's daughter couldn't go  
<br />
so he took the train by himself, to Spokane, Washington and then a  
<br />
bus to Moscow and then got on the phone to the Dome, &quot;Come and get  
<br />
me&quot;. His models had been carried up in John Pratt's car. Ed  
<br />
Solenberger told me that he was still building up to the end. We can  
<br />
only hope that we will be still be around and functioning at that age!
<br />
<br />Goodbye Earl - - - Chris Borland - Sacramento
