One thing that hurt this past year is Wright Stuff moving out of High Schools. I didn't coach any schools this year because none asked. 
<br />
<br />I actually have met 2 people who hate indoor flying. That would be the past and present Georgia directors of Science Olympiad. I think the main reason that they hate the event is that they have to actually work to find a place to do it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: Re: [Indoor_Construction] Solutions for Indoor FF
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not help but to chime in here. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Doctor Hacker's name has been mentioned a few times I would like to say a few words about him and his influence on me.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I first showed up to a S.O. meet with a kit built model which was in a state of perpetual stalling. Hack saw something in me, a fire worth stoking, which he stoked. He reached out to me by contacting my school and asking me to build a pennyplane. Hack took me under his wing and introduced me to a hobby which has shaped my life in numerous ways. I feel fortunate to be have been a part of the initial influx of juniors into the hobby, which was only initiated by the S.O. Without the involvement of Hack, not to mention John Kagen, Don and Chuck S, Larry Lucka, and many others, my involvement would have fizzled. They not only motivated and supported me with ideas, techniques, and rubber, but also with kindness and friendship. I take personal offense to the comments that called my friends introverted or nuts or crazy. This is not the case.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Without my involvement in Indoor FF, I would have never been able to pursue my passions the way that I do today. I developed a love for balsa wood and model making that drew me to the field of Architecture. The act of making, the craft that is inherent in building a model and the subsequent testing and tweaking involved in flying it taught me how to think critically and how to be a creative problem solver. I was also fascinated by the personalities of my fellow competitors. There were times where I walked too fast next to a stooge and was asked to walk slowly. However, I never felt unwelcome or experienced any negativity from anyone.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not been actively involved in the indoor community for about 6 years, and I regret not maintaining my involvement. Despite that, I still read the indoor emails daily, and have kept my AMA membership current. I have difficulty managing my time now with a full time job and the daily rigors of life. I find it inspiring to think about the people who work, have a family and social life and still find the time to build and fly models. I need to re-prioritize and get Indoor back up to the top of my list.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that there are &quot;structural problems&quot; with the hobby. It has existed, for the most part unchanged, for roughly half a century. The Wright brothers built in essence a large scale model airplane that relied on the same aerodynamic principles which we employ in our planes (wing warping) to fly. In the last 100 years aviation has advanced in leaps and bounds. We can now fly non-stop across the united stated in 5 hours, when in 1900 it was a week long affair.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though Indoor is a highly specialized form of model aviation, I think that what is not broken should not be fixed. Instead of criticizing the hobby in general, we should be looking for creative ways to engage new people with our hobby. We should be collaborating on ideas about how to market the hobby to younger people (outside of S.O.), working together to procure flying sites on a regional level and strive to build and maintain solid relationships with the owners/operators of these sites (An example is the strong ties to Lakehurst that Romash has built)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear to me that I need to make time for indoor once again, not only because I need it to fill a void in my life but also because I would be happy to help with the issues I just mentioned.

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to do with your posts and your continued negative 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;characterizations of the indoor free flight community. Your perception 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of an indoor free flight modeler shows both arrogance and ignorance. For 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a person who claims to be a &quot;progressive&quot; thinker I find your general 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attitude to be continuously insulting and condescending. Perhaps when 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you can stop name calling the whole indoor community perhaps you will be 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken seriously and perhaps get some respect back . Boasting about how 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great YOUR outdoor FF sport is and saying how archaic and out of touch 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the indoor FF guys are is getting old and I am tired of hearing that 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horse manure spread across the internet. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indoor is a highly specialized aspect of aero modeling that has always 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had a relatively low number of participants. Criticizing an indoor 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modeler for asking a person to walk slow or asking a parent to gain some 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;control over their child in a public place at a model event is hardly a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;valid criticism. Have you spent days or weeks on a model only to have it 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destroyed by a careless spectator? Ask my dad how is Manhattan Cabin was 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destroyed by a spectator at USIC, or his EZB? A simple &quot;Sorry&quot; means 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing and does nothing when you spent months preparing your models to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attend the USIC. If a person tells you to slow down then that means you 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were walking too fast. If you talk too loud in the library thy tell you 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be quiet. It is a matter of respect and courtesy in the venue you are 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in. So until you stop characterizing the indoor community the way you 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do, you comments on what our &quot;problems&quot; are nothing more than spam.
<br />
