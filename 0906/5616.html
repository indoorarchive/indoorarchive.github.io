I could not help but to chime in here.
<br />
<br />Since Doctor Hacker's name has been mentioned a few times I would like to
<br />
say a few words about him and his influence on me.
<br />
<br />I first showed up to a S.O. meet with a kit built model which was in a state
<br />
of perpetual stalling. Hack saw something in me, a fire worth stoking, which
<br />
he stoked. He reached out to me by contacting my school and asking me to
<br />
build a pennyplane. Hack took me under his wing and introduced me to a hobby
<br />
which has shaped my life in numerous ways. I feel fortunate to be have been
<br />
a part of the initial influx of juniors into the hobby, which was only
<br />
initiated by the S.O. Without the involvement of Hack, not to mention John
<br />
Kagen, Don and Chuck S, Larry Lucka, and many others, my involvement would
<br />
have fizzled. They not only motivated and supported me with ideas,
<br />
techniques, and rubber, but also with kindness and friendship. I take
<br />
personal offense to the comments that called my friends introverted or nuts
<br />
or crazy. This is not the case.
<br />
<br />Without my involvement in Indoor FF, I would have never been able to pursue
<br />
my passions the way that I do today. I developed a love for balsa wood and
<br />
model making that drew me to the field of Architecture. The act of making,
<br />
the craft that is inherent in building a model and the subsequent testing
<br />
and tweaking involved in flying it taught me how to think critically and how
<br />
to be a creative problem solver. I was also fascinated by the personalities
<br />
of my fellow competitors. There were times where I walked too fast next to a
<br />
stooge and was asked to walk slowly. However, I never felt unwelcome or
<br />
experienced any negativity from anyone.
<br />
<br />I have not been actively involved in the indoor community for about 6 years,
<br />
and I regret not maintaining my involvement. Despite that, I still read the
<br />
indoor emails daily, and have kept my AMA membership current. I have
<br />
difficulty managing my time now with a full time job and the daily rigors of
<br />
life. I find it inspiring to think about the people who work, have a family
<br />
and social life and still find the time to build and fly models. I need to
<br />
re-prioritize and get Indoor back up to the top of my list.
<br />
<br />I do not believe that there are &quot;structural problems&quot; with the hobby. It has
<br />
existed, for the most part unchanged, for roughly half a century. The Wright
<br />
brothers built in essence a large scale model airplane that relied on the
<br />
same aerodynamic principles which we employ in our planes (wing warping) to
<br />
fly. In the last 100 years aviation has advanced in leaps and bounds. We can
<br />
now fly non-stop across the united stated in 5 hours, when in 1900 it was a
<br />
week long affair.
<br />
<br />Even though Indoor is a highly specialized form of model aviation, I think
<br />
that what is not broken should not be fixed. Instead of criticizing the
<br />
hobby in general, we should be looking for creative ways to engage new
<br />
people with our hobby. We should be collaborating on ideas about how to
<br />
market the hobby to younger people (outside of S.O.), working together to
<br />
procure flying sites on a regional level and strive to build and maintain
<br />
solid relationships with the owners/operators of these sites (An example is
<br />
the strong ties to Lakehurst that Romash has built)
<br />
<br />It is clear to me that I need to make time for indoor once again, not only
<br />
because I need it to fill a void in my life but also because I would be
<br />
happy to help with the issues I just mentioned.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Don, give me a break with the nitpicking. I did not know F1L was in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the AMA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rulebook. Of course I knew it was an FAI event.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What does this have to do with my core message--that indoor FF has some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; serious problems that need fixing?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It has to do with your posts and your continued negative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; characterizations of the indoor free flight community. Your perception
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of an indoor free flight modeler shows both arrogance and ignorance. For
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a person who claims to be a &quot;progressive&quot; thinker I find your general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attitude to be continuously insulting and condescending. Perhaps when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can stop name calling the whole indoor community perhaps you will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taken seriously and perhaps get some respect back . Boasting about how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; great YOUR outdoor FF sport is and saying how archaic and out of touch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the indoor FF guys are is getting old and I am tired of hearing that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; horse manure spread across the internet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indoor is a highly specialized aspect of aero modeling that has always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had a relatively low number of participants. Criticizing an indoor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modeler for asking a person to walk slow or asking a parent to gain some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; control over their child in a public place at a model event is hardly a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; valid criticism. Have you spent days or weeks on a model only to have it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; destroyed by a careless spectator? Ask my dad how is Manhattan Cabin was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; destroyed by a spectator at USIC, or his EZB? A simple &quot;Sorry&quot; means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing and does nothing when you spent months preparing your models to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attend the USIC. If a person tells you to slow down then that means you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were walking too fast. If you talk too loud in the library thy tell you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be quiet. It is a matter of respect and courtesy in the venue you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in. So until you stop characterizing the indoor community the way you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do, you comments on what our &quot;problems&quot; are nothing more than spam.
