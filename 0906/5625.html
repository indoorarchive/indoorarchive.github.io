I already posted the reason, but here it is again and I will reword it 
<br />
one last time. You have on repeated occasions taken it upon yourself to 
<br />
make negative comments on the indoor community as a whole and its 
<br />
'perceptions' as you like to say. I have read your messages many times 
<br />
and I take exception to your views and negative comments. I am tired of 
<br />
your blanket statements and generalizations going unchallenged so I am 
<br />
publicly speaking out against your views and your labeling and 
<br />
belittling of the indoor community. Instead of thinking &quot;What have I 
<br />
said or posted that would make a person think this about me?&quot; You brush 
<br />
it aside and label me as a pitiful person who is having a bad day :-) 
<br />
<br />I do not know how else to explain it clearer. I am not ranting, I am 
<br />
just tired of hearing your comments go unchallenged. I am speaking also 
<br />
for those who I know who are silent on the topic as they do not want to 
<br />
get involved.  The reason it is &quot;personal&quot; is because YOU are the person 
<br />
who said these things, so I am addressing my comments to YOU 
<br />
specifically about the comments YOU have publicly said about the indoor 
<br />
community. Please take responsibility for what you have said and realize 
<br />
not all people appreciate what you said.  So it is not a surprise to 
<br />
find people will not be open to suggestions from the very person who 
<br />
previously insulted them.
<br />
<br />If you really want to discuss how to get more people into indoor then by 
<br />
all mean discuss it. But if the topic is &quot;We need to get more people 
<br />
into indoor because indoor is a bunch of old farts who yell at kids and 
<br />
blah blah blah&quot;  Well who is doing the insulting now? That is the 
<br />
attitude you need to get rid of. That is what I am talking about and the 
<br />
whole point of my posts. I do not know how else to make it more clearer 
<br />
and you either get it or you don't.
