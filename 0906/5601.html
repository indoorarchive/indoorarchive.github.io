&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: [Indoor_Construction] Solutions for Indoor FF
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi John
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;John
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for engaging in this discussion. I should say that as soon as I hit
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;send&quot; last night I knew I would catch hell for my rant. Just please
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;understand it was sent in the spirit of trying to find solutions to the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;problems inherent with our hobby/sport. If in trying to be constructive by
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;stirring the pot I came across as a bit abrasive, well, I apologize!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to your arguments:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm big and you are puny, so you should get on board with me. Not a great
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;way to earn support. Especially since, in the big picture, &quot;you&quot; are pretty
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;small too.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;--the fact is that the Big Tent of Outdoor Free Flight is around 3-4 times
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;bigger than the participant base of indoor FF. Indoor flyers need NFFS a lot
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;more than NFFS needs them. Too many guys look at NFFS membership as a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;magazine subscription. It is not! 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And, while we are on Nats numbers, let's take a peek at your claim that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Indoor FF is &quot;the smallest of all of the tiny factions of aeromodeling&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2008 Nats Registration: Control Line Scale: 20, RC Combat: 35, RC Electric:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;24, RC Helicopter: 27, RC Scale: 38.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;--point taken...glad to learn that! But in the AMA membership surveys I'll
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;bet the breakdown still looks something like this: RC 90% CL 5% FF 4% Indoor
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;FF 1%. Indoor flyers NEED the clout of NFFS!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;How about we use this message instead: We are all in the same boat. We
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;need to do the same kinds of things to boost participation. Let's work
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;together.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;--yes, right on. Thanks for capturing that!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">  &gt;&gt;`--virtually every indoor event has been loopholed to death and taken over
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;by expert flyers. The only remaining rays of light are A-6 and LPP, and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;perhaps F1L. Two of those three are not AMA events.'
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, two of those three *are* AMA events - but that's nitpicking.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;--LPP is an AMA event but F1L and A-6 are not. A-6 needs to be an AMA event.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the event that Easy B used to (and was intended) to be!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Your common theme is that we have to change the activity to make it more
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;appealing, and I couldn't disagree more. Indoor FF has inherent appeal. In
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;16 years I haven't met a person yet who wasn't awestruck.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;--This is an interesting question for sure. As a marketer I am trained to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;believe that you tailor your product to the demands of the marketplace.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tailoring the marketplace is a helluva lot harder. Think hard about this. Is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;indoor FF willing to be so esoteric that we only have a target market of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;engineers/PhDs? That is how things are now, largely because the genre is so
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;technically demanding. As to your observation about the appeal by outside
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;observers, I agree, but how many of them are thinking &quot;I can do this. It
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;seems accessible&quot;? Not very many, IMO. Most are thinking, &quot;These guys are
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;nuts. I don't have the time or patience for something so difficult!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing this perception might be indoor's biggest problem. Contrast this
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;with the visitor to the average outdoor FF contest. There are guys flying
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;fast and loud airplanes, and they are riding motorcycles! This *seems* a lot
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;more accessible and fun to the average Joe. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;There are plenty of events to get a newcomer hooked, and the harder events
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;are waiting when they are ready. Worrying about the minimum weight of EZB
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is barking up the wrong tree, as least as far as this topic is concerned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially since F1L is a 1.2 gm EZB.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;--You are right in that F1L has supplanted EZB as the everyman's lightweight
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;indoor event, but EZB is still festering in the rulebook as an event gone
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;wrong. Just my opinion!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;What we *do* need to do is work on exposure and flying sites.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone loves Indoor FF. A small fraction has the whatever-it-takes to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;actually pursue it. The more people you expose, the larger number that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;small fraction&quot; generates - a la Science Olympiad. A simple concept, but
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;one that helps us focus in the right direction.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;--absolutely true. It is a numbers game. Out of 5000 kids 1000 will be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;interested in airplanes, and perhaps 10 of those will actually build an
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;indoor model. One out of those 10 will be named Brett Sanborn. It's a lot of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;work!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW - as an outsider, the concept of driving a motorcycle around in circles
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;under an F1A ship and flapping is freaky. Do you feel you guys need to cut
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that cr*p out to attract new participants?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;--This only happens in California where people are generally weird anyway,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, outdoor FF is generally not having trouble attracting new
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;participants. That's just my observation!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I read an article that lamented the rubber situation, declining
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;participation, lack of flying sites - and predicted the complete demise of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Indoor FF within a few years. The interesting part was that the article was
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;in a 30 year old issue of INAV!! (I just searched through my stack of junk
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the basement to try to find it, but I'm way too messy, unfortunately).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;--too true. The same thing was being said in MAN and AAM about outdoor FF,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;during the heyday of the sixties! Sites disappearing, the Junior problem,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;yada yada. The kind of &quot;leaders&quot; that make these predictions need to shut
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;up. &quot;If you think you can't succeed, you're right.&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My prediction is, and you can mark my words: Indoor FF will never die. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;--I love this attitude and I wholeheartedly agree. Free Flight in general is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;just too cool to die. The challenge is, are our rules-makers and leaders
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;paying enough attention to the realities of the marketplace in which we
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;operate? This is a constant fight.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My second reaction is, Yeah.we need to plan ways to communicate with
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;visitors that fulfills their curiosity - without negatively impacting what
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;we like to do.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;--Very well said. Perhaps a nice brochure or something. Let me know your
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;ideas and how I can help.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to continue exposing ourselves (well, exposing our activity
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;anyway). I've tried to do my small part by writing stuff, but we need lots
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;more. People love Indoor FF when they see it. They just need to see it
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;more.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;-- I think Romash has found the best solution to the problem of indoor
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;recruitment: He just forces planes into the hands of interested spectators.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Romash is the insurgent terrorist of indoor PR/marketing...I love it!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;We also also need to continue obtaining flying sites. The site is the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;chicken to the participation egg, but that's the part we have direct control
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;over.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;--this seems like the easy part to me. Indoor site are everywhere, compared
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to good outdoor sites.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Rgds
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don
<br />
