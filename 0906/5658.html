Don D, Let's start with the part where we do agree:  
<br />
<br />- We want more people participating in Indoor FF, especially contests like USIC where the facility rental depends on having enough people to cover the cost.  Whether or not the &quot;future of Indoor FF&quot; depends on increased numbers, it is certainly more fun with more people involved.
<br />
<br />I tried to think of a good way to discuss and evaluate our various &quot;plans&quot; for growing participation, and the best that I've come up with is for us to start with a separate thread for each plan.  It is going to get messy, there will be overlap, and the separate threads will surely start to merge.
<br />
<br />Also, based on past experience here, and in other communities, we won't reach an agreement on all &#x2013; or probably even any &#x2013; of the issues.  But I think the exercise will be valuable to the people who choose to take on the challenge, forge ahead, and make change in a benevolent dictatorship kind of way.
<br />
<br />BTW &#x2013; since I'm presenting my own plan, I am going to feel warranted to say what I think is wrong with parts of the other plans.
<br />
<br />The &quot;Kagan&quot; plan:
<br />
<br />1)	Continued effort on the &quot;three ingredients&quot;:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Make information available &#x2013; so newcomers can get themselves going (Internet, youtube, magazines, books, TV, etc.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	Obtain and retain flying sites &#x2013; requires a special sales-guy personality (the &quot;Places to fly&quot; ingredient)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	Develop local critical-mass groups &#x2013; requires a special leader personality (the &quot;People to fly with&quot; ingredient)
<br />
<br />2)	Give newcomers a feeling of accomplishment to keep them hooked.  Specifically: a 5 and 10-minute medal/award/certificate for achieving a 5 and 10 minute flight with any model.
<br />
<br />3)	Make USIC back into an event-of-the-year
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Tune up the schedule to, for example, encourage the glider guys to invest in the trip (I'm working on that now)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	Keep a site record list and make it prestigious (Cat IV AMA records are not likely at ETSU)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	Banquet?  (ugh.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.	Think of other reasons to make people *want* to come (not feel like they have to)
<br />
