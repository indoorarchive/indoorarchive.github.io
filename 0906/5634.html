Why do you fly anyway? And why do you compete?
<br />
<br />If you compete to win, then you aren't going to be active for very
<br />
long. Either you will realize that you aren't going to win (for
<br />
whatever reasons) and quit, or you will soon find that winning isn't
<br />
everything. At least that's my experience with other activities.
<br />
<br />Most people that I know compete because they enjoy competing. They
<br />
enjoy being challenged. They enjoy having a way to mark their process.
<br />
They actually enjoy the process of doing.
<br />
<br />I think that the best way to get new folks is to show how much fun it
<br />
is to do, and how rewarding it is to make friends and just hang out
<br />
with folks doing the same things.
<br />
<br />This is not to say that beginners don't need to be encouraged, just
<br />
that they don't have to win.
<br />
<br />One of the most thrilling experiences was the second time I hooked up
<br />
with Ray Harlan. I had built a pair of LPP's and with a lot of effort
<br />
they were at about 3.4 grams. I was struggling to get 3 minutes at MIT
<br />
(I think it's got a 45 foot ceiling). Ray came over, watched me wind
<br />
and fly, made some suggestings and I got flights over 7 minutes. I was
<br />
thrilled and definitely hooked.
<br />
<br />I found out later that Ray bragged on me to a co-worker who happened
<br />
to be a good friend of mine.
<br />
<br />It is sometimes difficult to reach out a hand to a beginner or someone
<br />
who is just showing interest, but I think that's the best way to get
<br />
people interested. Tinkering with rules and categories will produce
<br />
events that are fun to fly, which is important to keep interests, but
<br />
I don't agree that we should improve the NATS by making it easier for
<br />
more people to win. After all, this is supposed to be the National
<br />
Championships.
<br />
<br />I've only attended one USIC, money and medical issues have prevented
<br />
more attendance, and I certainly didn't expect to win, or even place
<br />
highly in any event, but I went anyway. I had a great time and will
<br />
attend again if I resolve the problems that I have.
<br />
<br />Am I a mutant? I don't think so.
