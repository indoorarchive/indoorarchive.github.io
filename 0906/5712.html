The guy had a potty mouth too! Nothing like a string of epithets roaring throughout the tranquil air of Kibbie dome. He loved to dance. Had a couple girlfriends he didn't want knowing his age. The sweetest gentleman (really).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Earl Hoffman passed away last month in Santa Rosa, California. The  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; following was written by his friend Ed Solenberger.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Earl Hoffman 1912-2009
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Earl Grew up in Detroit and spent much of his younger years in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; several interesting activities. One of which was Ice Boat Racing. He  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had a narrow escape when his boat plunged through the ice. He was  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rescued from what would have been death by freezing. He had many  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other stories to tell.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; During WW2, he served the Government as a meteorologist. He was  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stationed in the area of Devil's Lake in North Dakota until the end  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the war.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Earl was very active model flying, both outdoor and later indoor. He  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set several records and is one of less than 100 people, worldwide,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who flew over 40 minutes. There have been flights of 1 hour, but very  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; few! Most of these flights were done in very high ceilings, some in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; foreign countries.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Earl has four sisters and a son, plus a number of grandchildren, of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whom he was very proud.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ed Solenberger - Santa Rosa
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have a couple of highlights of Earl's career to share. In 1988, 75  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; year old Earl drove by himself to the Nationals at  East Tennessee  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; State and won both EZB and Intermediate Stick. To top off this feat,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in September of that year at Santa Ana, he flew to a new Int. Stick  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; record of 31:19. This design, which he called the &quot;Symphony&quot; was then  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; named indoor model of the year in 1989 and the plans of which are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; featured in all the plans books.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; After Moffett Field was closed to indoor (and everything else),  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Earl's daughter began driving him to Moscow, Idaho for the annual  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kibbee Dome Meet where on into his 90's he had a wonderful time  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; competing. One year, now into his 90&quot;s, Earl's daughter couldn't go  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so he took the train by himself, to Spokane, Washington and then a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bus to Moscow and then got on the phone to the Dome, &quot;Come and get  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me&quot;. His models had been carried up in John Pratt's car. Ed  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Solenberger told me that he was still building up to the end. We can  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only hope that we will be still be around and functioning at that age!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Goodbye Earl - - - Chris Borland - Sacramento
</em><br />
