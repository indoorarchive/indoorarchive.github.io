Have been following this topic with interest. I've yet to fly any real 
<br />
indoor other than a couple of chunky Hangar Rats, but even those were 
<br />
incredibly satisying to build and fly. I intend to develop my building and 
<br />
flying skills further, and hope to attend USIC in the near future.
<br />
<br />I do wonder though if Indoor is really 'broken'. My perception is that it's 
<br />
the world around it that has changed, and there's very little that can be 
<br />
done to swell the ranks significantly. It seems to take a lot more than it 
<br />
used to to amaze the youth of today, and even if they are somewhat intrigued 
<br />
watching a duration model do a few laps, getting them involved any further 
<br />
will be a significant challenge. Once exposed, those that have the passion 
<br />
will generally continue regardless.
<br />
<br />Somebody mentioned cost, and I'm of the opinion that it's not a significant 
<br />
factor. Youths and adults alike continue to spend obscene amounts of money 
<br />
on anything from clothing to electronics, it's just a matter of priorities.
<br />
<br />Reading some of the posts reminded me of a video I saw in Switzerland a 
<br />
couple of years ago while traveling with the US F3B team. It was black and 
<br />
white, and showed dozens of high school aged kids taking a train to fly 
<br />
outdoor free flight up in the mountains somewhere. In the snow. It was 
<br />
fascinating to watch, but I couldn't imagine that it was still happening 
<br />
today, nor likely anytime in the future. Aviation was eminently more 
<br />
fascinating at that time, and there was far less other stuff to do.
<br />
<br />By all means expose the youth to indoor, and take what you get. Which will 
<br />
be a miniscule percentage, but I don't believe that can be changed too much. 
<br />
Many of the same perceived issues exist in other segments of modeling, and 
<br />
most of those are far easier to get into and be competitive. The great thing 
<br />
is that materials and assistance seem to be readily available, and that 
<br />
helps tremendously.
<br />
<br />Craig.

Subject: [Indoor_Construction] beginner's (entry level) duration plane
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I reluctantly agree with those who feel we cannot recruit many youth to 
<br />
indoor free flight, for various reasons. We don't have to look further that 
<br />
Tim Lavender's group to see that even with excellent mentoring most youth 
<br />
are not interested in pursuing this hobby. Have any of his kids continued in 
<br />
the indoor free flight hobby?  Our local group has assisted the SO program 
<br />
for many years, but have never had anyone interested in continuing on in 
<br />
Free Flight.
<br />
We have however had several adults (both retired &amp; pre-retirement) attend 
<br />
our flying events. We have two flying sessions per month, except in the heat 
<br />
of summer. The two things these newcomers seem to share in common is:
<br />
1. They are intimidated by the small sizes of the wood we use. 1/16&quot; &amp; 
<br />
smaller seems to be the tipping point.
<br />
2. An interest in scale airplanes.
<br />
We offer to assist them in building an A6, but often even this is more than 
<br />
they are willing to undertake.
<br />
If you were to design an entry level duration plane, what would the 
<br />
specifications be?
<br />
I think the prop &amp; hanger/bearing is an area needing some though.
<br />
Personally, I picture something easier that an A6 but better performance 
<br />
than a delta dart.
