John, Don S. and Don D. I have had the opportunity to fly with all three of
<br />
you a few times, and I have a great deal of respect for all of you.
<br />
I think that the reasons that people fly Indoor has a lot to do with how it
<br />
is perceived.  At USIC this year probably 80% of the people flying were the
<br />
best from their states. Thus, I think that most of the people left are very
<br />
serious about that they do. And yes, I takes money and time to accumulate
<br />
rubber, film, wood ect. required to win at USIC.  The people who have put
<br />
the time and money into it deserve to be at the top. I think this is what
<br />
Don S. is going after. The unfortunate part is that their are no training
<br />
wheels for Indoor if you enter the hobby as an adult. I think this is what
<br />
Don D. is saying. But, the problem with making beginner events is that the
<br />
experts figure out how to fly them and after about two years they're not
<br />
beginner events anymore. They flip side from what I've seen in Outdoor is
<br />
that if you have some cash you can compete even without 20 years experience.
<br />
That's not to say that you'll win, but it does give you a much better hope
<br />
of winning. Nevertheless, I think Indoor not being a quick sport in any
<br />
interpretation of the word is its number one asset. Indoor has taught me a
<br />
lot about life as I've grown up flying. Now that I'm mid way through my
<br />
college career at Emory University I value the perseverance that F1D has
<br />
taught me and the attention to detail that indoor in general has taught me.
<br />
For that I wouldn't change Indoor expect to encourage the &quot;experts&quot; to keep
<br />
doing what they always have. I've known several experts to reserve flying
<br />
seriously only for a few events and instead help new comers trim and fly
<br />
their models when they could be flying their own.
<br />
To everyone that has help me along the way, A heart felt thank you.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you take offense to my post then? Good. I have read your constant
