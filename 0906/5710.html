<br />
Thank you for the tolerant replies to my earlier posting.  They make me
<br />
think a few further words may be useful.
<br />
<br />First, although no one has mentioned this, please don&#x2019;t think of me as a
<br />
Limey telling the Americans how to run their indoor flying.  To me the
<br />
Indoor List is International and in this country we have the same question
<br />
of where Free Flight is going, and as far as I can see the decline in
<br />
participation is a world wide problem.
<br />
<br />At no time have I talked of &#x2018;throwing in the towel&#x2019;.  On the contrary, I do
<br />
think it is necessary to make changes but primarily for the benefit of the
<br />
existing body of Indoor flyers.  It would be nice to attract newcomers but
<br />
to my mind it is more important to look after the people we have.
<br />
<br />I served on our Ruling Body a few years ago and saw at first hand something
<br />
of the time and money that went into attracting newcomers.  I think I am
<br />
right in saying that the number of &#x2018;Delta Dart&#x2019; kits produced went into the
<br />
hundreds of thousands, many schools used them, the children enjoyed doing
<br />
the projects, but that is what they were &#x2013; projects.  When the project was
<br />
finished it was finished.  What are we doing next term Miss &#x2013; is it pond
<br />
life?  I have never known anyone who knows of any aeromodeller who took up
<br />
the hobby from handling a &#x2018;Delta Dart&#x2019;.
<br />
<br />What to do for the present flyers I don&#x2019;t know but perhaps some of the
<br />
following will raise some thoughts;
<br />
Prune the classes, particularly the beginners models that never have been.
<br />
Introduce a new class each year and get rid of it in two years. (These need
<br />
some novelty aspect like tailless or two motor sticks.  The first year is a
<br />
feast of experimentation, the second year the experts might be getting on
<br />
top but then you all start again.  Great Fun)
<br />
Think in terms of flying in smaller sites which are more readily available.
<br />
Consider if some area centralized competition could be arranged (Competitors
<br />
fly at their nearest venue all on the same day and post results.  We do this
<br />
with outdoor FF but I do realize the problem of ceiling heights.)
<br />
Would there be any interest in flying competitions with part motors and
<br />
ballast rods so that more competitions could be flown on the same day.
