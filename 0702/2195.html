There are some good articles here, including one by Ray Harlan on making  and 
<br />
using a pitch gauge:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<a href="http://www.soinc.org/events/wrightstuff/index.htm">http://www.soinc.org/events/wrightstuff/index.htm</a>
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The pitch is supposed to be about right as is.  Get the right motor  size 
<br />
before adjusting the pitch.  The kit is supposed to have three  different widths 
<br />
of rubber.  The thicker motor will climb faster.  In  case you do not have a 
<br />
ruler in 0.01&quot; divisions, the equivalents of the standard  rubber sizes are:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
1/16&quot; = 0.0625&quot;
<br />
3/32&quot; = 0.09375&quot;
<br />
1/8&quot; = 0.125&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
3/32&quot; is probably best.  The length is also important.  A longer  motor will 
<br />
take more turns and will run longer.  There is also a 2 gram  weight limit on 
<br />
the motor which limits its length.  A 1/8&quot; motor will be  made from 24&quot; of 
<br />
strip and will be a bit less that 12&quot; long when knotted.   The 1/16&quot; strip can be 
<br />
4' long and will make a 2' long motor.  The 3/32&quot;  strip will be 32&quot; long and 
<br />
will make a motor a bit less than 16&quot; long.   These numbers are approximate, 
<br />
based on typical rubber density, measure and  weigh to be sure.  The 1/8&quot; 
<br />
motor will take about 1,100 turns, the  1/16&quot; will take about 3,200 turns and the 
<br />
3/32&quot; motor will take about 1,800  turns.  Your mileage will vary, depending 
<br />
on your rubber and winding  technique.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
If you got up to 1,800 turns on the 3/32&quot; motor, you are doing really  well.  
<br />
If you didn't feel the motor tightening up a lot and if your winding  
<br />
technique is not really good, you probably have 1/16&quot; strip.  You will need  to put a 
<br />
lot more turns into it to get it to climb.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Weigh your airplane to make sure it weighs close to the 7 gram  minimum.  If 
<br />
it is much heavier than that, it will not climb.  Ask  your science teacher if 
<br />
you can use the lab balance if you don't have a way to  weigh in grams, 
<br />
actually centigrams, 0.01 gram.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Read everything in the instructions carefully.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Read the article by Bob Clemens and follow other links to learn more of the  
<br />
terminology.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
One thing I have seen is the prop shaft points down.  Some times the  front 
<br />
of the stick gets worn and the socket of the prop hanger becomes loose,  then 
<br />
the motor pulls the socket back so the propeller points down.  If the  stick is 
<br />
worn, glue balsa shims on as necessary and sand it back down to correct  
<br />
cross section.  Check the plan and make sure the prop shaft points the  correct 
<br />
direction.  If it points down too much, that will hold the plane  down.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
These props don't turn very fast.  Have you seen any others  flying?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Based on what you have said, my first guess is the motor is too thin.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Don't use scotch tape to repair rips in the wing.  You won't be able  to keep 
<br />
it straight.  Sometimes a bead of slightly diluted glue drawn  along the rip 
<br />
will pull it together by capillary and hold.  You can use  narrow strips of 
<br />
the film and dilute glue.  Best would be to recover the  wing.  If the rip 
<br />
doesn't open up during flight, it might not be necessary  to fix it.
<br />
