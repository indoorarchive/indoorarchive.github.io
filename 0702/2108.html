Kurt,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;Well, my Time Machine design is a standard glider weighing about 2 to 2.5  
<br />
grams.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
That gives an idea of the average loading in the steady glide.  If  there was 
<br />
some way to estimate the load distribution over the wing, the force  acting 
<br />
on the flap in the down position could be estimated.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;I have loaded the wings of this design by putting weight at the root of  the 
<br />
wing and supporting the wing 1/2&quot; from the tips on each side. To get up 40  
<br />
ft a wing needs to hold 75 grams of weight, otherwise they break on  launch.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
This may be a good estimate of the launch load that breaks the wing.   I 
<br />
think the load on the wing may be more than that.  With  the load concentrated at 
<br />
the tips, it would break with less load than if the  load were distributed all 
<br />
over the wing.  How can you sandbag a glider  wing?  Support the fuselage 
<br />
with the glider upside down.  Perhaps load  with little blocks of lead.  
<br />
Distribute the load elliptically along the  span and according to some plausible chord 
<br />
wise distribution, at least so they  balance near the CG, even though we 
<br />
don't know the CP location in the  launch.  This might even give some idea of the 
<br />
flexing, bending and  twisting of the wing and flap.  But let's go with the 75 
<br />
grams of lift  at launch.  The weight force of 75 grams is 980 x 75 = 73,500  
<br />
dynes.  Applied to a 2 gram glider, that would produce an acceleration  of  a 
<br />
= F/m = 73,500/2 = 36,750 cm/sec^2 = 1,206 ft/sec^2.  Yes,  37.5 g's.  If we 
<br />
assume that the launch speed is 90 miles per hour, 4,023  cm/sec, we may 
<br />
estimate the radius of the flight circle as v^2/a = 440 cm  = 14.5 feet.  Does this 
<br />
combination of numbers seem plausible?   (v^2 is v squared.)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I said &quot;net lift&quot; because when the glider is going much faster than its  
<br />
steady glide speed, it will be accelerated upward.  That can reduce  the attack 
<br />
angle on the wing and increase the negative attack angle on the  tailplane.  The 
<br />
setup of forces then may become, front to back, first the  CG pulling outward 
<br />
around the circle, next the lift on the wing, pulling inward,  then the 
<br />
negative lift on the tailplane, pulling outward.  These three  forces must add up, 
<br />
so the full wing lift is the sum of the accelerational force  on the CG and 
<br />
the negative lift on the tailplane.  It's hard to know what  the forces actually 
<br />
are.  With the wing attack angle reduced, you would  expect the CP to move 
<br />
aft, as required.  Your observations of the bunting  also suggest the tailplane 
<br />
was negatively loaded in climb, implying the above  force setup was operating. 
<br />
&nbsp;But most of the load on the wings would be  opposed by the centrifugal 
<br />
force, not the tailplane load.  It is too far  away and must be much smaller to 
<br />
make the balance.  The tailplane may be  snapping from a dynamic load rather than 
<br />
a static load.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The loads at the instant of release of a catapult launch can be  
<br />
significantly different than suggested above.  A line through the hook and  the CG will 
<br />
show the attack angle during launch, which might be quite  large.  There are 
<br />
other forces to consider; the rapid accelerational force  and the sudden increase 
<br />
in drag.  The shape of the break may tell you which  way the load was 
<br />
applied.  Often a little chip will pop out on the inside  of a break.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
There is so much going on here that we cannot see.  We must work from  
<br />
inferences.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
