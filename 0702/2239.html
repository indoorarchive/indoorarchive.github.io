<br />
&nbsp;It is a measurement of angle of blades. I never have been able to 
<br />
tell by just looking at propellar how much angle (Pitch) a propellar 
<br />
has! Using a protrator to rest blade flat on it reading degree angle 
<br />
of protractor and then measuring distance from protractor to prop 
<br />
holder where hub (prop shaft hole is at or actually center of prop)
<br />
are the three measurement to gather. The rest is math to calcuate 
<br />
ratio.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Another purpose of pitch gauge and going though whole process of 
<br />
measuring both blades on propellar is to get each blade pitched 
<br />
exactly same. If they aren't same the prop will wobble making rest of 
<br />
plane do the same. It is most noticeable with a shaking stablizer if 
<br />
difference in blades pitch is slight. If one blade is different it 
<br />
will make higher pitch blade pull more air and other work less. Both 
<br />
these faults lead to less flight time. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;The resulting pitch ratio tells you how much air the blade is 
<br />
grabbing when turning. Another way of thinking about higher pitch is 
<br />
for each turn it moves forward further. A P/D ratio of 1.9/1 grabs 
<br />
more air than lower ratio like 1.4/1 likewise it moves forward 
<br />
further each rotation of propellar. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;If higher pitch ratio travels further each turn will the plane
<br />
fly faster? The answer is No in real world experience because of 
<br />
interaction with rubber motor energy. Since motor energy applied to 
<br />
propellar is constant it takes more to make each rotation of blade. 
<br />
What happens is the plane travels forward slower. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Talking about efficiency of prop and motor combination a prop ratio  
<br />
between 1.8/1 and 2.2/1 is the best in theory. Since your limited to 
<br />
two grams of rubber (energy) it would be best to use it in best 
<br />
manner possible for longer flight times.      
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Other flying conditions to consider. In lower ceiling heights a 
<br />
common problem is reaching ceiling to fast bumping into it. A higher 
<br />
pitch slows travel speed down so it take longer to reach ceiling. 
<br />
Pitch ratio's of 2.0/1 or higher can be flown effectively but the 
<br />
rest of plane must be trimmed out almost perfectly else plane will 
<br />
not climb. Often falling out of air at launch or shortly afterward. 
<br />
It is difficult to fly at that ratio for that reason. A pitch ratio 
<br />
of 1.6/1 to 1.8/1 gets you high effiency levels and makes life much 
<br />
more easy till rest of plane is trimmed out better and small warps 
<br />
are eliminated.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;The bottom line is what you get from measuring pitch will lead to 
<br />
greater flight times. By first avoiding numberous problems then by 
<br />
knowing where your at in terms of effiency.
