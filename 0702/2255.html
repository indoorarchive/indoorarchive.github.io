There have been several good suggestions made for solving your problem. Here's one that you might not like but is very effective:
<br />
After getting the model trimmed on contest day glue all the posts into their sockets. I've told many teams to do that. If they win and get to go to the next level they can always do whatever it takes to get the model apart after the event is over and before the next one. One thing I always stress is that if your wing or stab falls off you are seriously out of luck.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: [Indoor_Construction] Wing Post Sockets (tubes)
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Science Olympiad team has a plane that is right at the minimum 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;weight and is well trimmed. An excellent prop/motor combination has 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;been found through many flights. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower rounded portions of the wing posts have apparently shrunk 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;or compacted slightly over time and are starting to get looser in the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;wing sockets than the kids would like. They are made from 1/16 square 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;balsa. The students don't want any unexpected, unintended changes in 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the angle of incidence of the main wing during a flight if, for 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;example, the plane collides with a beam. The students would rather 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;not replace the wing posts and risk damaging the wing. Unfortunately 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the wing posts and their angles braces were glued to the LE and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;trailing edge spars with CA. The students don't want to have to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;change the wing post sockets on the MS for fear of damaging the motor 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;stick. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose you could cut off the lower segments of the existing 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;wingposts and glue new segments over the same, with slightly larger 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;rounded portions, but the new lower segments would have to be 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;perfectly aligned to maintain the proper wash in on the inboard 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;traing edge. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a good way of adding some material to the rounded lower ends 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the wing posts to so that they fit more snugly in the wing post 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;sockets? Someone mentioned putting a layer of CA on them. But then 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;you can't do the temporary fix of wetting them so they expand. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;For wing post sockets our team is using Post-it tabs rolled around 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;drill bits and held together with Duco, as recommended in Lew 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gitlow's book. They have found them to be much better wing post 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;sockets than those rolled from Japanese tissue which get mushy and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the plastic tubes which are difficult to securely glue to the motor 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;stick. They only weigh about .02 grams each. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for your recommendations. 
<br />
