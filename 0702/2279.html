I suggest my approach with F1D's and F1L's which have the same problem. Attach thin slivers of thin balsa (up to 10 thou) or if not possible, strips of tissue, using Ambroid or similar; these bulk up the posts where needed. Cyano sets too hard and adjustment for a good fit is very difficult to get right. I haven't tried talc and cyano.
<br />
<br />As regards trim setting, I ensure that the posts can go right through the sockets and when I believe the trim is correct, I cut off the posts flush with the far end of the socket. Next time out, assemble with posts flush with the sockets. Marks are OK if you only need one on each post, but you'll be lucky if you do!

&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: [Indoor_Construction] Wing Post Sockets (tubes)
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Science Olympiad team has a plane that is right at the minimum 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;weight and is well trimmed. An excellent prop/motor combination has 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;been found through many flights. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower rounded portions of the wing posts have apparently shrunk 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;or compacted slightly over time and are starting to get looser in the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;wing sockets than the kids would like. They are made from 1/16 square 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;balsa. The students don't want any unexpected, unintended changes in 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the angle of incidence of the main wing during a flight if, for 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;example, the plane collides with a beam. The students would rather 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;not replace the wing posts and risk damaging the wing. Unfortunately 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the wing posts and their angles braces were glued to the LE and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;trailing edge spars with CA. The students don't want to have to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;change the wing post sockets on the MS for fear of damaging the motor 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;stick. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose you could cut off the lower segments of the existing 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;wingposts and glue new segments over the same, with slightly larger 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;rounded portions, but the new lower segments would have to be 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;perfectly aligned to maintain the proper wash in on the inboard 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;traing edge. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a good way of adding some material to the rounded lower ends 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the wing posts to so that they fit more snugly in the wing post 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;sockets? Someone mentioned putting a layer of CA on them. But then 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;you can't do the temporary fix of wetting them so they expand. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;For wing post sockets our team is using Post-it tabs rolled around 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;drill bits and held together with Duco, as recommended in Lew 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gitlow's book. They have found them to be much better wing post 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;sockets than those rolled from Japanese tissue which get mushy and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the plastic tubes which are difficult to securely glue to the motor 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;stick. They only weigh about .02 grams each. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for your recommendations.
