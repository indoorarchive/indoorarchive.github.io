<br />This agrees with my results flying outdoors. Even in the freezing
<br />
temperatures you get the same maximum torque into the rubber (of course
<br />
winding will warm to rubber some, so this may also have some effect), but
<br />
then during the climb you can really tell that the cruise torque is lower
<br />
than in the warm. Actually, in the heat of the summer the rubber tends to
<br />
get softer and break more easily, and under lower torque, so on the
<br />
hottests days I tend to use slightly lower maximum torque to aim for.
<br />
During the day it is not that essential after all, as during thermal
<br />
activity you either hit or miss the good air anyway.
<br />
<br />This has some interesting consequences for indoor flying: you can no
<br />
longer predict the cruise torque from the maximum torque that you get to
<br />
the rubber, but in the cold the drop from maximum to cruise is higher, and
<br />
you need to go to a thicker cross-section for the same cruise torque...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; By the way Tapio, how is your F1M flying these days and did you get your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; VPs working?
</em><br />
<br />I have one VP that is working quite well, and have been flying at about
<br />
the same level as I did in USIC and West Baden. Under lower ceiling my
<br />
times are not that good, something around 12 minutes in Cat I, so I should
<br />
get the VP a bit better. I still somewhat struggle with the weights and
<br />
structure for it though. Would prefer using some metal or carbon parts to
<br />
make the unit easier to reproduce, as all balsa construction seems so
<br />
&quot;every unit is unique&quot; approach to me, but not much success there. I even
<br />
built my first F1D last autumn, way too heavy and the motor tube collapsed
<br />
once I started to get some idea of the trimming. At the moment I'm busy
<br />
with contest season on F1B, peaking with the World Champs at the end of
<br />
June, but I plan to do some indoor duration stuff again during the latter
<br />
part of the year, including another F1D. I hope some day I'm good enough
<br />
to travel with my models to some champs or to another USIC. At the moment
<br />
my skills are not good enough to justify such a trip.
