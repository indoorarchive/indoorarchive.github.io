Are you catapulting the Poker? On mine once you get to the speed where the flaps buzz it is really hard to make it go any higher. When I was flying it in 2 classes in Cat 1 my times for HL and CL were usually only a second difference even though I could get a lot more velocity with catapult. One reason for this was that my HL was usually at a lower angle and the glider would retain a lot of energy at the top of the climb. For catapult it was basically a straight up launch with the whole glider vibrating and a flop into the glide at the top. The catapult launch would get me another foot or two of altitude but only about a second more time.

<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I found with my Slow Pokers etc that if flaps are too thin ( much thicker than you quote) that they flutter at launch or deflect so easily that the model won't recover trim from a slightly imperfect launch. Presumably you haven't had this problem.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Last season I was flying a 100si version of the SlowPoker in both HLG and UCLG. It weighed about 8 grams. I could HL it about 27-28' and catapult it to maybe 40'. The limitation on the HL height is my arm strength. Cat 1 times for both classes were around 42 seconds and the best flights at Kent were around 53 seconds.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;For flaps my big glider uses .020 A-grain wood that is actually a little thinner than that now. At the farthest point in that I can reach with my caliper the thickness is about.016&quot;. For SCLG for Cat 1 I've gone to .010 or .012 wood for the flaps. When you get into the .010 range I don't think it matters too much whether the wood is A grain or C grain. To me it's a lot easier to use thin wood than to try to sand down something thicker so that it will deflect properly. I would read Stan Buddenbohm's SlowPoker article a couple of times to understand his philosophy.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it's going to be difficult to get a 6 gram glider to almost 40' with a handlaunch but Buxton could probably do it. My feeling is that a larger glider would give you more launch energy and more altitude potential.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't have any experience at high altitudes - yet. I think for catapult that a slightly stronger version of a Cat 1 glider would do well. For HL I really don't have a clue what will work. I'm planning on building a new Cat 1 SCLG to take to Colorado Springs in hopes that the thin air will let me get an extra 10 feet of altitude.

<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been tinkering with my flappers under our 37-39' ceiling and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm certain I don't have them shaped correctly. If I build lightly 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;at 6-7 grams, I can't get them anywhere near the ceiling but I can 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;with 9-11gm versions. These are 21-24&quot; gliders.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't the theory that under launch conditions the flaps will flatten 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;out due to air pressure and drop down as the airspeed decreases? If 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;so this gives a pretty good undercambered airfoil and a resultant 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;slow minimum sinkrate glide, all things being in trim.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It is likely that flaps need to be very, very limber in the hinge 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;area and this likely requires balsa with very few hard grain lines 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;so that the material is pretty much homogeneous. In addition, I 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;think I work that area much too thick for the flap to actually 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;respond properly.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So here is my question: How do you make the flap as flexible as it 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;needs to be and is there a way to judge that? I notice on Kurt's 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;website that the airoil detailed there has a top curvature that is 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;continuous whereas the undercamber has been carved into the front 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;section and it transitions up to a very thin flap.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So if I build this airfoil such that the flap is very thin and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;flexible will it help get a lighter glider to the roof?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks, Randy
