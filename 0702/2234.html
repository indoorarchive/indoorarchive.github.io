&quot;Hi, I was wondering if someone could explain to me how these P/D ratios  
<br />
work. I don't understand what you measure, and what you can get from it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;...well I use a commercial gauge from freedomflightmodels.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Shown here:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
P/D is the ratio of pitch P to diameter D of a propeller.  The pitch  is the 
<br />
nominal distance a propeller will move forward in one revolution.   The idea 
<br />
comes from screws.  The pitch of a screw is the distance between  adjacent 
<br />
threads, which is the distance the screw would travel forward in a  nut or wood in 
<br />
one revolution.  The same concept applies to springs.   You are familiar with 
<br />
the spiral bound notebook binding.  The wire loops  through a series of holes 
<br />
in the edge of the paper.  Every time the wire  goes around once, it moves 
<br />
one hole further on.  The distance between holes  is one pitch.  This curve is 
<br />
know as a helix.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
With propellers we must distinguish between geometrical pitch and  
<br />
aerodynamic pitch.  Geometric pitch is based on the movement of a chord  along a line 
<br />
parallel with itself, as if it was a screw moving through a  solid.  The 
<br />
propeller blade is like a twisted wing flying around in a  tight circle.  At each 
<br />
point along the radius the cross section through the  propeller blade is the 
<br />
airfoil at that station.  The chord of the airfoil  is the straight line segment 
<br />
joining the leading edge and the trailing  edge, or some similarly defined 
<br />
line.  Often it is defined as the  projection of the airfoil onto a straight line 
<br />
that the airfoil would lie flat  on.  Whatever convention you accept to define 
<br />
the chord line, it makes an  angle with the plane of rotation of the 
<br />
propeller, called the blade angle.   The size of the blade angle will be different at 
<br />
different distances out along  the radius of the propeller.  As the propeller 
<br />
rotates and moves forward,  the chord line moves along a helix on a cylinder.  
<br />
If the chord  follows a line with the same angle as the chord, it will move 
<br />
forward one pitch  distance in one revolution.  If the chord traces a line on 
<br />
the surface of  the cylinder and you cut the cylinder and unroll it flat, you 
<br />
will have a  rectangle with height equal to the pitch and base equal to the 
<br />
circumference of  the cylinder, or pi times the diameter.  The helical path will 
<br />
flatten out  to form a diagonal of the rectangle.  The angle at the base is 
<br />
equal to the  blade angle.  By relating the forward motion to the circular 
<br />
motion we have  found a triangle that relates the quantities.  The ratio of the 
<br />
height of  the triangle to the base of the triangle is the tangent of the blade  
<br />
angle.  You can find the tangent function on most calculators, including  one 
<br />
on your PC.  In other words, the pitch divided by pi times the diameter  
<br />
equals the tangent of the blade angle.  This can be turned around to say  the pitch 
<br />
is equal to pi times the diameter times the tangent of the blade  angle.  In 
<br />
the general formula, the diameter is the diameter of the circle  at the radius 
<br />
of the airfoil in question.  It also works at the tip, where  the diameter is 
<br />
the full diameter of the propeller.  There is a close  connection between 
<br />
pitch and blade angle.  Some authors use &quot;pitch&quot; to  refer to the angle.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The picture shows the pitch gauge from _www.freedomflightmodels.com_ 
<br />
(<a href="http://www.freedomflightmodels.com">http://www.freedomflightmodels.com</a>) .   It uses a protractor to measure the blade 
<br />
angle at a particular station along  the blade radius.  The pitch of the 
<br />
propeller AT THAT STATION can be  calculated from the radius and blade angle.  To use 
<br />
it, you must measure  the distance from the propeller axis, the wire shaft, to 
<br />
the protractor.   Guestimating from the photo, it looks like the radius at 
<br />
the protractor is about  2.5&quot;.  The local diameter is thus 5&quot; and the 
<br />
circumference is pi times that  or 15.71&quot;.  The blade is resting flat on the edge of the 
<br />
&nbsp;protractor.  You can see that if the protractor read zero, the blade chord  
<br />
would lie flat in the plane of rotation.  The protractor shows that the  blade 
<br />
chord is at an angle of about 26 degrees to the plane of rotation.   The 
<br />
tangent of 26 degrees is 0.4877.  Multiplying that by the circumference  of 15.71&quot; 
<br />
gives a pitch of 7.66&quot;.  This is at a 5&quot; diameter, so the P/D is  1.532.  We 
<br />
can leave out the intermediate calculation of pitch and just say  P/D equals 
<br />
pi times the tangent of the blade angle.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
A rough estimate of the P/D at the tip can be made by looking at the  
<br />
triangle formed by the tip blade chord and the plane of rotation.  The  vertical rise 
<br />
of the chord corresponds to pitch.  The horizontal run  corresponds to 
<br />
circumference.  About one third (one over pi, to be exact)  of that corresponds to 
<br />
diameter.  So the ratio of the rise to about one  third of the run is P/D.  You 
<br />
can usually estimate this well enough by  eye to get two digits.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Depending on the twist of the propeller, the pitch could be constant along  
<br />
the whole length, or it could vary.  A prop with constant pitch all along  the 
<br />
radius is said to be helical.  On a helical prop, the blade angle  varies 
<br />
along an arctangent curve.  My measurements on an IKARA  propeller showed the 
<br />
blade angle varied linearly.  It is a can formed  blade.  You can see it would fit 
<br />
on a cylinder if you look at it along the  right offset line.  Mine is a 
<br />
pretty good fit on a 4&quot; diameter can.   The pitch and P/D measured at one point 
<br />
doesn't tell the whole story.  It  can be used as an indication of relative 
<br />
pitch when twisting prop blades.   When the whole blade is twisted at the root, 
<br />
all blade angles change by the same  amount.  The pitch and P/D change by 
<br />
different amounts along the  radius.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
When a propeller flies through the air, the chord must meet the air at a  
<br />
slight attack angle.  The blade does not make the same angle with the air  as it 
<br />
does in the helical movement described above.  It follows a helix  through the 
<br />
air with a smaller base angle.  Aerodynamic pitch is thus  different from 
<br />
geometric pitch.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
For a given blade and motor torque, the lower pitch propeller may give  
<br />
better efficiency transferring torque to thrust, but it will turn faster and run  
<br />
down sooner.  The higher pitch prop will run longer, but it will waste a  lot 
<br />
of energy.  Somewhere between these two extremes is the propeller that  
<br />
produces the bast combination of efficiency and running time.  Finding the  best 
<br />
combination of motor and propeller for your airplane and ceiling height is  a 
<br />
matter of testing many combinations.  This is why it is important to  measure 
<br />
things and write them down in a notebook.  Keeping good notes is a  foundation for 
<br />
good scientific and engineering work.
