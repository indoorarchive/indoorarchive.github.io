<br />Good to see you today Peter...
<br />
<br />I have to ask this question, if it wasn't broken, why fix it? You've
<br />
done well at Glastonbury in the past, why not continue with what you
<br />
used before?
<br />
<br />I've used LPP props with pitch from 18 to around 24 inches and at the
<br />
local sites my times have been about the same after playing around
<br />
with rubber to try and match the prop in sites around New England.
<br />
<br />Having said that a lower pitch prop, will spin faster and have more
<br />
thrust than a higher pitch prop. I think I've read somewhere that a
<br />
P/D of 2 is theoretically more efficient than lower pitch, but I'm not
<br />
sure if efficiency is all that important with low ceiling LPP
<br />
flight. It seems that control of the energy release in the prop is
<br />
more important than efficiency. Time(s) will tell.
<br />
<br />Having said that it seems to be common practice to use large flaring
<br />
blade props in lower ceilings. My latest prop has a prop shaft that is
<br />
about .03x.3 inches tapering to .03 x .03. The blades twist up at high
<br />
torque. Durig launch the torque causes the prop to twist to a higher
<br />
pitch and depending on the launch torque the model will actually lose
<br />
a little altitude. As the torque drops, so does the pitch and the
<br />
model climbs. Ray Harlan's model had a similarly acting prop.
<br />
<br />It is going to take a bit more fiddling with blade size and area and
<br />
spar placement to &quot;optimize&quot; the flight to the flying site.
<br />
<br />I had a similar prop when I last flew at Lakehurst and even without
<br />
any backoff the model never went any higher than about 50 feet. This
<br />
prop was definitely not the right one for a high site.
