<br />Hey don't worry about asking dumb questions. I ask them all of the
<br />
time. There are a bunch of folks in this group that are more than
<br />
willing to help. I've gotten answers for my dumb questions from World
<br />
Champs, record holders, and just great people with experience, and
<br />
opinions, to share.
<br />
<br />I don't know where you are, but building an F1D can be a daunting
<br />
enterprise, and getting some local help can be a great advantage.
<br />
Being able to ask questions in &quot;real-time&quot; and being able to see
<br />
examples of how things are done can really help. My first F1D had
<br />
problems, but a few minutes with Ray Harland and Fred Tellier more
<br />
than doubled my time.
<br />
<br />Post your location and ask for help. If someone is nearby they will
<br />
likely volunteer to help you and the young lady out.
<br />
<br />And why not make it your hobby? It's a great activity. All things
<br />
considered, it is inexpensive, challenging, and I find it very
<br />
satisfying. You mention jigs, if you like to make jigs, there are
<br />
plenty of opportunities to make them.
