Peter,
<br />
I've only been flying indoor models for a couple of years now, all my  
<br />
flying has been at Glastonbury and I've only built and flown three  
<br />
LPP's. My current model is a Frankenstein made up of parts from the  
<br />
three  of them. In my inexpert opinion, the model doesn't matter too  
<br />
much, it's the prop that's most important.
<br />
John Kagan and I have been friends since we flew F3B models together  
<br />
years ago. I met Max Zaluska at a contest three years ago at  
<br />
Glastonbury and we have become friends. The first time John and Max  
<br />
came to my house and looked at my props they actually laughed at me.  
<br />
Not exactly the way to encourage a beginner but i guess they knew I  
<br />
could take it. They also offered a lot of advice that has resulted in  
<br />
a prop that works very well at Glastonbury.
<br />
It's based on the Jim Celm shape with a flexy basswood spar (john's  
<br />
input), the spar located right at the trailing edge of the blade and  
<br />
the blades constructed of .025 C grain laminated at a 45 degree angle  
<br />
to the spar. It is pitched at 19&quot;.
<br />
My best time at Glastonbury is 8 min 34 sec and my best official  
<br />
contest flight has been 8:05.
<br />
Here are my observations with respect to matching rubber to prop  
<br />
(comments are welcome):
<br />
When I flew the model with a 10&quot; loop of .085 3/99 tan 2 and launched  
<br />
with a torque of 1.8 to 2 (units unknown-readings from Wayne Johnson  
<br />
torque meter) I couldn't keep the model out of the rafters. I reduced  
<br />
the cut to .075 and started using longer loops, up to 13&quot; and finally  
<br />
settled on 11.5 to 12&quot;. A 12&quot; loop takes 1650 turns, back off 150,  
<br />
launch torque 2.7. The model climbs with authority and after a couple  
<br />
of lucky bunps form the curtains near the ceiling settles into a very  
<br />
slow climb and a long cruise. we observed that on the best flights  
<br />
the model didn't begin to actually loose altitude until about 5  
<br />
minutes into the flight. Another observation was that the longer  
<br />
thinner motor seemed less sensitive to launch torque than the shorter  
<br />
thicker one. The launch profile didn't seem to change much when  
<br />
launching at 2.1 to as much as 2.7 which I attribute to prop flare  
<br />
and a shorter burst from the longer motor. Not sure of the physics at  
<br />
work here and would appreciate some input.
<br />
Tom
