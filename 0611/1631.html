<br />&nbsp;That's happened to us before. Like you, I wasn't about to take on all those people. I quietly approached one of coaches explained I wasn't demanding they leave but just wanted it not to happen again. Offered to go over our gym schedule at later date. Before I knew it both coaches were asking me for half hour to get out. Since then we have all gotten along very well including giving each other some extra time for various reasons because things do happen. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;The spring girls drill team is another story. Mats, props, music equipment, girls, MOTHERS every where. Tried same approach which was not taken very well by their coach. Only thing I got was they were more important. In leaving (by the way I didn't respond to her) I mentioned what happened to the janitor on the way out. The Janitor said wait a moment. He unlocked the principals office coming out with the gym schedule. Walked directly into the gym headed to electrical panel. What happened next even stunned me. He shut off the lights then turned them on again telling them to leave. Suppose those turkey's at Thanks Giving and cookie's by S.O. girls at Christmas had anything to do with his action?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;BTW, You S.O. people can over come the numbers game by asking other S.O. events to practice at same time.
<br />
We have always had storm castle, wheeled vehicles, scrambler, balloon race and robot ramble practice at same time. They use the side of gym behind basketball nets with rules on not running or walking while a plane is in flight, works out well. We even ask some of the study event people to take practice tests then or ask them questions out a books. My favorite is asking Physic Lab questions which has helped with the planes.

<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Bill:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My sympathies. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar thing happened to our SciOly team last Spring after we had 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;reserved the high school's field house. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Later on it turned out that the basketball teams had actually 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;reserved the smaller middle school gym but apparently liked the much 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;field house better, and glommed onto it before our scheduled start 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;time. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As practical matter, we couldn't evict twenty-four players, their 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;coaches, parents, etc. Our Wright Stuff team missed out on some 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;quality practice time before our state finals. The smaller gym is 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;too small and has too many obstructions. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, it seems like sports too often take precedence over 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;science in this country.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for letting us know what happened and we hope we hear results 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of Little Square's flying soon.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Sincerely,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Calgoddard
<br />
