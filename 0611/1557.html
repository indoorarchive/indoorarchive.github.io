Yes, I'm familiar with the PVHC prop blanks.  What you describe  would have a 
<br />
pitch of 8.64&quot; and P/D of 1.57, which is good for this plane.   You can get a 
<br />
more precise figure by measuring the thickness of the block  from the front 
<br />
face to the rear face, most easily measured right across the  blank at the 
<br />
centerline, and the width of the blade chord at the tip.  The  ratio of the 
<br />
thickness to the chord is the sine of the blade angle at the  tip.  From that may be 
<br />
calculated the blade angle, then calculate the  tangent of that angle.  The 
<br />
tangent times pi is the P/D and that times the  diameter is the pitch.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Make a full size drawing of the prop so you can reproduce it if  necessary.  
<br />
It is cut from a rectangular block.  The side view is a  rectangle.  The front 
<br />
and end views will show the outlines of the rectangle  with the two parallel 
<br />
lines denoting the edges of the blank.  You can use a  plastic prop as a 
<br />
pattern for the blade outline and airfoil.  There are  several guides to prop 
<br />
carving on the Internet.  Most of the cutting has  been done, only final shaping 
<br />
and finishing is necessary.  Be careful about  drilling the hole, get it 
<br />
centered and perpendicular to the block.  Some  like to cover their prop with tissue, 
<br />
others use polish.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
On the plan that I have, with the correct 16&quot; wingspan, the motor stick is  
<br />
9&amp;13/16&quot; long, so I can't see how you could have got the rear hook at  11.5&quot;.  
<br />
The plan shows it just ahead of the tailplane, which is fine.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
There are three things I would suggest you work on.  Get it to fly in  the 
<br />
largest circles you can safely fit into the space, with the wings as level  as 
<br />
possible.  Try different wing positions, glide test with motor on but  with 
<br />
ballast to replace prop to find the lowest rate of descent, or power test  with 
<br />
about 70% of winds, to get the quickest climb from floor level to eye  level, 
<br />
and note the CG position on the wing chord.  Try different motor  thicknesses, 
<br />
wind to at least 90%.  When you change motors, move the wing  to get the CG in 
<br />
the same relative position as shown in the earlier tests.   On each flight, 
<br />
record turns put in, turns left on landing, how close to  ceiling.  Not getting 
<br />
to ceiling suggests too thin a motor.  Having  many turns left on landing 
<br />
suggests too thin a motor.  Hitting ceiling  suggests too thick a motor.  Running 
<br />
out of turns midair suggests too thick  a motor.  A different prop might work 
<br />
better, but the rules limit your prop  selection.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Bob is right, the rules are too restrictive.  But those are the rules  and if 
<br />
other guys are getting two minutes, you should be able to also.
<br />
