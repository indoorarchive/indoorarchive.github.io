Papa,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
It's hard to answer the question without more information.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;According to local rules ...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
What are the local rules?  What is the locale, in particular, what is  the 
<br />
ceiling height?  The ceiling puts a limit on how much rubber can be  used 
<br />
because it limits the amount of energy that can be used.  The torque  curve has a 
<br />
certain shape and the energy curve has a certain shape and it has to  &quot;fit under 
<br />
the ceiling&quot;.  A thicker motor will allow a faster but  shorter climb.  A 
<br />
thinner motor will allow a slower but longer  climb.  Ideally the plane takes off 
<br />
from the ground with a fully wound  motor, climbs and levels off just under 
<br />
the ceiling, descends with the prop  turning and lands just as the last few 
<br />
turns come out of the motor.  If it  does that, that is the best time you can get 
<br />
with that plane.  It takes  several trials to find the best motor.  The plan 
<br />
shows 3/32&quot; strip, a bit  thicker than I would use in our low ceiling (24').  
<br />
What is included in the  kit?  A quick guess for good starting motor cross 
<br />
section: measure torque  to fly level.  On the midpoint of the torque curve, 
<br />
calculate the cross  section to meet that torque.  Calculate length from cross 
<br />
section and  maximum weight.  My guess is this will result in a motor longer than 
<br />
&nbsp;12&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;...I have to use the prop block in the kit ...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
What kit?  The one sold by Penn Valley Hobby Center?  Is it  required to 
<br />
build everything from the kit?  You should use the lightest  wood you can get that 
<br />
will do the job.  If you must use kit wood, put the  heavy wood in front and 
<br />
the light wood in back.  What are the dimensions of  the prop block?  Can you 
<br />
determine the pitch?  Using a prop block  allows some choice concerning the 
<br />
blade shape, airfoil used and even a bit of  latitude on pitch.  The plan shows 
<br />
a prop made from sheet, scored and  cemented.  A terrible prop.  It also shows 
<br />
rubber rings being cut from  a bicycle inner tube and linked together to make 
<br />
the motor.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;...plane cannot weigh less than 5 grams with 12&quot; of rubber.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I assume 12&quot; is the motor length, since the hook distance is a bit  more than 
<br />
8&quot; and the usual practice is to make the motor 1&amp;1/2 times the  hook 
<br />
distance.  So if you have a two strand motor, the rubber is  24&amp;1/2&quot; long.  If there 
<br />
is no limit on motor weight, build the plane as  lightly as possible and cut 
<br />
the motor to whatever width will get your total  weight up to 5 grams.  That 
<br />
seems light for a kit Phantom Flash, so I  assume you mean the plane must weigh 
<br />
no less than 5 grams without the  motor?  Several things may be done to lighten 
<br />
the structure without  modifying the areas, if the rules allow.  The wing 
<br />
ribs don't have to be  full depth.  The tips can be laminated.  The rudder can be 
<br />
laminated  and R-2 can be reduced to a couple pieces of 1/16&quot; square and a 
<br />
short  trapezoidal gusset.  Use only one central rib A.  The wing mounts can  be 
<br />
simplified, but add cross pieces sticking out on either side, over which  
<br />
small dental rubber bands are fit to hold the wing down.  Not only lighter,  but 
<br />
easier to get on and off.  Cover with lightest film.  Use the best  rubber you 
<br />
can get for the motor.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;Some people are using penny plane thrust bearings.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Or put a tiny drop of oil on whatever bearing you are using.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Glide test the plane with the prop replaced with an equal weight and find  
<br />
the wing position that gives minimum rate of sink.  Fly in the largest  circles 
<br />
you can fit in the site safely.  The rudder is offset for a left  turn.  On 
<br />
the plan that I have, the right wing is a bit longer than the  left.  Some 
<br />
people would reverse that, to counter the motor torque.   Some would use a bit of 
<br />
washin (raise leading edge, about 3/16&quot;) on the left tip  to counter torque 
<br />
roll, and this also develops an adverse yaw to the left.   You might want a bit 
<br />
of right thrust if the initial torque rolls it too much  left.  A banked plane 
<br />
is a sideslipping plane is a plane falling down and  wasting energy.
<br />
