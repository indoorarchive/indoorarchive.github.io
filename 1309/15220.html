I think that I am more or less in accordance with Bill Gowan on this.  I was
<br />
fortunate to be advised to use weight per unit length in my early days in
<br />
Indoor flying and it was so obviously sensible that I adopted it straight
<br />
away.  Talking to people who used a rubber stripper it became apparent that
<br />
one could not cut a strip to a width that was accurate to better than
<br />
several thousandths of an inch and it was equally apparent that a width
<br />
difference of several thousandths made a big difference in performance. Now
<br />
although strip width is very important from a performance point of view it
<br />
is a difficult thing to measure with normal measuring instruments and the
<br />
weight per unit length is a simple and sufficiently reliable way of
<br />
predicting the way the rubber will work in a motor.
<br />
<br />I should mention, in case any newcomers to Indoor read this, that flyers
<br />
strip their rubber as closely as possible to the weight/unit length (or
<br />
width) that they require but almost always some pieces will be wider or
<br />
narrower than intended.  Each piece is measured and put into a little
<br />
envelope with the actual weight/unit length (or width) recorded on the
<br />
outside.  When flying these 'near similar' pieces can be used to make motors
<br />
that enable the flight performance to be finely tuned.
<br />
<br />My procedure when stripping rubber is as follows:
<br />
<br />I run several A4 sheets through my printer as attachment below.  I cut each
<br />
sheet to make four small envelopes, each printed with the following on the
<br />
outside: g/inch, g/m, width(approx.) and turns/inch.
<br />
<br />I cut a piece of rubber for stripping 40&quot; long.  This is usually long enough
<br />
to cut several motors but short enough to wrap conveniently into the
<br />
envelopes.  I set the stripper to the width I want and cut a strip.  I then
<br />
weigh the strip. Divide the weight by 40 and write on the envelope the
<br />
g/inch.  Divide by 1.016 and mark g/m to compare with people who use funny
<br />
units!  Like Kang I multiply the g/inch by 1.5 to give a strip width which
<br />
is good enough for people who ask.  For convenience I put on the expected
<br />
turns/inch that a two strand motor will take.
<br />
<br />A final point that most flyers don't seem to think about; those thin offcuts
<br />
often left at the end of cutting a strip can make very effective multi
<br />
strand motors.

<br />
<br />First let me say that this discussion has gone in a direction I didn't
<br />
intend. My original statement was intended to say that telling another
<br />
person the width motor that you're using doesn't convey much in the way of
<br />
useful information. By the same token asking another person what width motor
<br />
they're using is not going to be very helpful to your own efforts to
<br />
understand what they are doing. What's important is length and weight and
<br />
how you arrive at those parameters can certainly be done many different
<br />
ways.
<br />
<br />To answer Gary's question I usually cut 2 or 3 one inch pieces from my
<br />
unstripped rubber, make a trial cut of one of them with my stripper and
<br />
weigh the cut piece. If it's not what I want I make an adjustment to the
<br />
stripper and try again. When I get a piece that I consider correct I'll
<br />
usually do another trial cut using a 2&quot; piece. If that looks good then I'll
<br />
cut a piece a little longer than the motor length I want and use the cut
<br />
piece to make a motor. I don't use anything to measure the width of the
<br />
strip at any point in the process. 
<br />
<br />After doing things this way for a couple of years I actually don't know how
<br />
wide any of my motors are. If you ask me about motor width and you get kind
<br />
of a blank stare from me then that's the reason.
<br />
<br />This is the method I use and it's what I'm comfortable with. It's like a lot
<br />
of other techniques used in indoor building and flying - there are lots of
<br />
ways to accomplish any given task and you just have to decide what makes
<br />
sense to you and what gives you the outcome that you are looking for.

<br />
<br />Bill, Mike or anyone, 
<br />
<br />But the catch-22 is that first you must accurately measure the width of the
<br />
strip, then accurately set your slicer to cut a specific width in order to
<br />
end up with a specific weight loop!
<br />
<br />For the sake of this discussion, assume there is no max. motor weight
<br />
requirement &amp; you wanted a loop weight of 1 gram, what tolerance would you
<br />
consider acceptable? 
<br />
<br />How many test cuts do you usually need when trying to cut a new width strip?
<br />
I would say it typically takes me at least 3 short test strips.

<br />
<br />So you calculate the density of your 1/8&quot; rubber and then calculate the
<br />
strip width based on the density. I rest my case.

<br />
<br />Here is an example for F1L.
<br />
<br />Find the loop length that you want. Cut a bit of rubber to be the length
<br />
plus 2 inches.
<br />
<br />i.e. 14&quot; loop, cut (14+1)*2 = 30 inch length = 15&quot; doubled.
<br />
<br />Measure the width of the rubber with micrometer - i.e. 0.128&quot;
<br />
<br />Weigh the length of rubber. i.e. 2.54 grams.
<br />
<br />You decide you want the rubber to weight 1 gram exactly. 
<br />
<br />Here is the math:
<br />
<br />1/2.54 * (15/14) * 0.128 = .05399
<br />
<br />Strip it to 0.054&quot; and you when you tie off a 14&quot; loop it should be
<br />
precisely 1 gram.
<br />
<br /><br />I set up the spreadsheet to have only 1&quot; additional length, but the math
<br />
above is the same.
<br />
<br />If anyone has problems with this, I will define variables and post the math
<br />
that way. 
<br />
<br />Regards.
