<p>Jim,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First I want to warn everyone that the advance ratio (AR) is a measured quantity found by measuring the&nbsp;airspeed of the plane&nbsp;and the prop rpm.&nbsp; The AR, or forward motion per prop revolution, is the airspeed divided by the rpm (the airspeed is in inches per minute - multiply by 60 for airspeed in inches per second).&nbsp; The helical block upon which one makes the blade does not need be the same pitch as the AR.&nbsp; For most it is not.&nbsp; Previously there was a poll in this group conce<var id="yui-ie-cursor"></var>rning which pitch block to use for forming the initial prop for an F1D.&nbsp; The answers were all over the place.&nbsp; I just chose to have the AR and pitch block match. Remember, too, that just because a blade is formed on pitch block of a certain pitch, that does not mean the formed blade will have that pitch as the balsa usually relaxes and changes shape after removal from the block.&nbsp; Many people fiddle around with the blades after forming, or do a second&nbsp; forming, to get the desired pitch distribution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As stated above, the airspeed of the plane does not alone determine the AR as the prop rpm matters.&nbsp; The AR on my current F1L is higher than most because the prop rpm is lower not because the plane flies slower than most.&nbsp; Brett Sanborn&#39;s F1L at this year&#39;s Nats had about the same airspeed and prop rpm as mine.&nbsp; Thus, it had the same AR.&nbsp; Bill Gowen says that my F1L gets away with having a higher pitch than usual because it has symmetrical prop blades (less flare) and stiff blades.&nbsp; Thus, the blades do not change pitch during the flight. This means that the blade can have a higher static pitch without stalling at high torques when the blade on other planes flare.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, for a flaring blade, the initial&nbsp;AoA is less than what I use so that the flared AoA does not get to high.&nbsp; This can be an advantage as this setup allows a lower pitch when the motor runs out or torque.&nbsp; This is how Brett&#39;s plane may work.&nbsp; Bill Gowen&#39;s F1L may work in a similar way but Bill&#39;s F1L flies heavier (and faster) than many others because Bill uses heavier (longer) motors.&nbsp; Bill&#39;s style of flying works as he has won the Nats at least twice in F1L (Brett is another Nats&nbsp;winner in F1L).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mike Kirda also has a point that the pitch distributions are similar no matter what pitch block one starts with.&nbsp; So, one can look at props as part art and part science.&nbsp; But, to answer your question, I think that most good F1L props fly with an AoA of around 7 degrees or a bit more and a prop rpm of 96-100 rpm at cruise.&nbsp; The good fliers do not worry much about this but rather adjust and trim their planes to fly the longest and that includes playing around with the pitch settings.&nbsp; That is why we bring pitch gauges with us to contests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Leo</p> <div class="ygroups-quoted" style="display:none;"><br><br>--- In Indoor_Construction@yahoogroups.com, &lt;indoor_construction@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:<br><br><div><div>Hi Leo,</div><div><br></div><div>Just read over your response a couple more times. &nbsp;I think I am catching on. &nbsp;Am I correct to say that most of the best F1L fliers mold their blades on pitch blocks about 7.5 inches less pitch than their actual blade setting will be? &nbsp;If so, why is that more efficient than using a pitch block with the same pitch as the setting used to attach the blades? &nbsp;Less drag? &nbsp;More thrust? &nbsp;Better washout? &nbsp;This is all very fascinating to me.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks Leo,</div><div><br></div><div>James Alderson<br><br>Sent from my iPhone</div><div><blockquote><span> <br>On Sep 8, 2013, at 5:10 PM, <a rel="nofollow">leop@...</a> wrote:<br><br></span><blockquote><div>

      <p>Jim,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A plane that advances&nbsp;or goes forward 22.5&quot; for each revolution of the prop is said to have a prop with a 22.5&quot; advance ratio (AR).&nbsp; If an EZB prop is built on a 22.5&quot; helical pitch block, has an advance ratio of 22.5&quot; (the as built helical pitch and the AR often do not come out to be the same), and is set at a pitch of 26&quot; at a 5&quot; radius, the prop blade will have an angle of attack (AoA) of 4 degrees along its whole length. How does one get the 4 degrees?&nbsp; The angle of a blade set at 22.5&quot; pitch is 35.6 degrees at a 5&quot; radius.&nbsp; The angle if the blade is set at 26&quot; pitch at a 5&quot; radius is 39.6 degrees.&nbsp; The difference of 4 degrees is the AoA of the blade.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An EZB is often a much lighter and slower plane compared to an F1L.&nbsp; The as flown AR&#39;s may not be the same so a good EZB prop design may not work well for an F1L.&nbsp; As a point of comparison, my current F1L flies with an advance ratio of about 23&quot; (this is by design and I built the prop on a 23&quot; helical block).&nbsp; I set my blades with an AoA of 7.5 to 8.5 degrees (or a 30&quot; to 31&quot; pitch at a 5&quot; radius).&nbsp; The prop has a 15&quot; diameter.&nbsp; This AoA (or pitch) is&nbsp;similar to many other F1L&#39;s,&nbsp;w hile the AR of my F1L is more than usual.&nbsp; Stan Chliton&#39;s Spirit F1L has an AR of just over 20&quot; and a pitch of 26.5&quot; (I do not know the exact radius but somewhere between 4.5&quot; and 5&quot;) for his 15&quot; prop.&nbsp; This gives an AoA of about 7-7.5 degrees.&nbsp; The same AR, AoA, and pitch are found on Laurie Barr&#39;s CargoLifter F1L (14.7&quot; prop diameter.&nbsp; Both of these planes are among the best F1L&#39;s and one cannot go very wrong copying their design parameters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Leo</p> <div><br><br>--- In <a rel="nofollow">Indoor_Construction@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;<a rel="nofollow">indoor_construction@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br><br><div>I am becoming more and more interested in propeller design and construction.&nbsp; Recently I read the following specifications found on Bernard Hunt&#39;s EZB plan from the early 1990&#39;s.&nbsp; Blades molded on 22.5&quot; pitch block/ Blades rotated to 26&quot; pitch at 5&quot; radius when attached to spar.&nbsp; Am I right in thinking that this would produce a prop with more blade twist that a standard blade formed on a 26&quot; block?&nbsp; More angle of attack at the root and less at the tip?&nbsp; (but standard 26&quot; pitch angle at the 5&quot; radius station?)<br><br>I&#39;d like to know how I can learn more about these types of adjustments and what they produce.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>James Alderson</div></div>
