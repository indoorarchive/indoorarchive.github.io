Hi,
<br />
      I have flown at the Uni-Dome many times.   Actually my Dad and I went last year and flew FF for two days.  We were &quot;kind of&quot; pushed to the end of the dome and didn't really have the best part of the building to fly in, but we were able to fly and did have fun.  There were about 6 to 10 Freeflighter's there, I think Dad and I were the only ones that were not local.  The Contest Director did what he could to make our flying enjoyable, but he did have a lot of RCer's to make happy so it was a compromise.      
<br />
     The site is big and if your able to fly in the best part of the building you have at least 130ft of ceiling.  The air has varied over the years, only once has the air been good, most of the time the air is fair to poor with turburence at about 75 ft.
<br />
     The Uni-dome has an interesting history, it once was a building whose roof was held up by air pressure, but there was a major modification to the building about 25 years ago and now the building is pretty much self-supporting, but there might an area right at the very top were were air pressure still is needed to hold up the roof.  I have been told the HVAC system must run all the time  and most of the time it appears to be on, but there appears to be a few times when it was off.   
<br />
       I would encourage you to go, fly and have fun, but don't expect to turn any great times and be aware its really a RC event but FF'ers are welcome.
<br />
 
<br />
Cheers,
<br />
 
<br />
Kurt

<br /><br /><br /><br />I flew there for several years along with several other USIC regulars, until they stopped allowing free flight. It is all RC now. The sight was OK, not great. Too much clutter in the ceiling area. Also, they wouldn't shut off all the fans so the was some drift, etc.

<br /><br /><br />Wow! So isn't there anyone on this list that flies there? Y'all trying to keep this a secret?
<br />
