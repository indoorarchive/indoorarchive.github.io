<br />If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me directly, but here is the latest info on CFH.
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
<br />Tony 
<br />
<br />Just a reminder that we will be having a fly-in at Cole Field House this Saturday (November 7) from 1-4PM.
<br />
<br />NOTE:  We will conduct one FAC Kanone event this Saturday---FAC NO-CAL MASS LAUNCH.  Dan Driscol has offered to run this event.  Thanks Dan!  Dust off your no-cals and let's have at it!  
<br />
<br />FAC NO-CAL RULES:
<br />
<br />I. Event is for recognizable profile scale models
<br />
II. Scale considerations:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Motor sticks shall not exceed fuselage length, however, the prop may be positioned at the tip of a scale profile spinner if the real aircraft utilized one
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Surfaces may be single covered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. All wing struts must be on the model
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Model must be in correct color scheme
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E. Model must have control outlines, registration numbers, etc.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F. Have proof of scale.  Judge's decisions are final.
<br />
III. Wing Span: 16 inches maximum
<br />
IV. Prop diameter: N/A
<br />
V. Launch technique: Hand
<br />
VI. Landing gear: Aircraft woth fixed landing gear must have each landing gear represented as per the original subject
<br />
VII. Official flight:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. 20 second minimum
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. NO MAX!
<br />
VIII. Scoring: Total of three flights
<br />
IX. Bonus points: N/A
<br />
X. Tie Breaking: fly-off
<br />
<br />NOTE!  NOTE!  ITEMS IN RED INDICATE OFFICIAL FAC FLIGHT RULES AS PER &quot;THE BOOK&quot;.  HOWEVER, WE WILL BE FLYING THE EVENT AS A MASS-LAUNCH, IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAC MASS LAUNCH RULES&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />A follow-up note regarding flying at CFH---due to legal concerns and thus AMA insurance regulations, the following rules will be in force at all CFH fly-ins:
<br />
<br />1) All participants MUST have AMA membership.  Please bring your card--you will be asked to present it.
<br />
2) All participants will be required to sign a waiver of liability when they sign in and pay their entry fee.
<br />
3) All participants will be asked to adhere to AMA rules of conduct, such as may be applicable to your area of interest.
<br />
<br />Sorry to bring the legal crud into all of this, but it's like this:  my name is on the contract with UMD.  Without the above regulations in force, in the event that something dreadful occurs, I could be held personally liable for damages.  I appreciate your consideration and acceptance of these rules, and sincerely apologize to any of you who may be excluded from flying as a result of them.
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />

<br />
<br />Through the efforts of Mike Guth, the Maxecuters have secured the University of Maryland's Cole Field House for a series of flying dates this season.   
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi everyone,
<br />
<br />I am pleased to report that we have secured three  2009 flying dates at the Cole Field House, located on the campus of the University of Maryland.  The dates and times are as follows:
<br />
<br />SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7th,     1-4 pm
<br />
<br />SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 29th,   1-4 pm
<br />
<br />SUNDAY, DECEMBER 13th,   1-4 pm
<br />
<br />At the last CFH event, $15 admission proved viable, so we will set that as the nominal entry fee.  If we get a large turnout, we can drop it to $10.
<br />
We will  look to have at least one official FAC kanone-winning event during these dates;  Dime Scale, No Cal, and Peanut Scale are obvious choices.  More info once the brass has knocked heads and come up with a platform.
<br />
The Nov. 7th date conflicts with the first day of the Eastern States Free-Flight Championship, but was the only date available to us in early November.  We felt that since there are not currently any FAC events scheduled for the ESFFC, and that there was otherwise very little area of specific overlapping interest, we would be relatively safe in taking this date.
<br />
<br />In Mid-December, we will be meeting with the CFH reps to discuss a new contract for rental space at CFH for 2010.  This will very likely include at least one date in January, 2010, an ideal month as students are dismissed from school then and competition for the space is diminished.  Because of this, the possibility exists for us to secure a longer time slot.  It is our intent to try and secure a 6 hour +- slot and to run a proper event, as per the NBM but distinct in some way that recognizes the larger space available at CFH.  Coconut Scale, anyone?
<br />
<br />I will keep you posted of further developments.  In the meantime, mark your calendars and prep your fleet....
<br />

<br />
Cole Field House is large enough to accomodate both indoor FF and indoor R/C simultaneously. If you are flying R/C,  please limit it to suitably slow and light aircraft, such as would be allowed in at the NBM.  No 3-D or Park Flyers, please.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Would Tony keep me informed about the Maryland site as some of our SOTS indoor members would make the trip and help with the expenses. Also I'm sure the DC Maxicuters  will want to fly there as well?
