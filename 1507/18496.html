I agree that it is inevitable to learn how to build a rolled motor tube, and starting off with F1L also helps a lot, but if juniors are provided materials in kits, resources for materials are limited and being able to build a good flying first F1D is a big morale boost, especially since learning to build F1Ds can be strenuous. When I spent a week at Larry Coslick's house during an F1D crash course, it is very intimidating and can be exhausting working at such a level of concentration for the first time, but when you get to see the model you built fly (and fly well) for the first time it is awe inspiring. What we don't want to happen is have juniors get discouraged from taking on F1D because there first attempt at building one resulted in unusable motorstick or parts broken during a build session. My first F1D was with a rolled motor tube, but having Larry as a mentor is a HUGE leg up. Although the nature of F1D requires a lot of skill and concentration, it is important to work up to that level of skill and concentration, especially if access to mentoring is not available. I'm not sure if a solid motorstick is the best way to do this, but it might help. Even after building the model, a solid motorstick is easier to handle and won't collapse, which a collapsing motorstick can be very disheartening. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Another idea I had came from when Larry sent me an F1L kit. In the kit, it came with practice parts in which I learned how to install thrust bearings before committing to the good wood. Maybe for practice with installing webs (or other parts) would be including a piece of 1/32&quot; balsa, then a piece around .020&quot;, to roll into motorsticks and practice attaching parts, and at the same time, getting used to the thinner, more fragile wood. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I think the biggest factor would be time. On my own, before I was mentored by Larry, it takes a lot of time learning indoor, and when I went to Larry's, I realized there was a LOT more to learn, and my own trial and error with LPPs only scratched the surface on what there is to learn with indoor flying. With the team selection coming up, finding a way for juniors to build good F1D's before the contest when an F1D crash course is not available is important.
