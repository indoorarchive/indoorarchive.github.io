Chris told us, &quot;Long story short, exposure (to indoor flying) is the key.&quot;
<br />
<br />I agree, but the actual results of exposure to indoor modeling are dismal, at least where youngsters are concerned. How many years have we exposed junior and senior high kids to indoor flying via the Science Olympiad Right Stuff event plus balloon-launched glider and soon the new helicopter event? Tens of thousands of students have flown nationwide in SO competition over the years. Many, girls as well as boys, built and flew their models very well indeed. As a mentor and event director I've seen amazing strides made in SO flying events. I doubt any other program have or ever will come close to the exposure level SO has given our hobby. I've also given dozens of indoor flight demonstrations for schools and Scout groups. Everyone in the many audiences is always amazed and impressed. But how many of these kids have begun or continued in full-fledged indoor flying/competition? A literal handful. Yes, a small group of SO graduates have most certainly done very well for themselves. But what of the other thousands? They are gone, probably never to come back. That's a pretty poor return, from our standpoint, for the effort many of us have expended in the SO movement. These days I'm flying and competing mostly outdoors. I see the same problem there, at the same time realizing exposure of outdoor flying to potential newcomers, young or old, is much more unlikely.
<br />
<br />I believe the simply fact is that model airplanes (as well as full scale aircraft and aviation in general) of whatever type simply don't hold anywhere near the lure for today's kids as they did- and still do for us . I doubt that this lure can ever be recreated on any meaningful scale. We will get a few kids plus some adult newcomers and returnees, but the glory days of our hobby, indoors or out, are gone. We are a slowly dying breed, like it or not. I plan to enjoy it as long as I can. Thankfully it will certainly outlive me.
