<br />
Every time this topic comes up it bothers me a little more. I came indoor as
<br />
a kid and I have continued to fly all the way through college. The more I
<br />
fly the less I care about competitive indoor. For most kids the goal of
<br />
getting into a top tier college affords all the competition they they need.
<br />
I certainly don't think that competition is unimportant, but after competing
<br />
in SO. TSA, AMA and FAI events there are only a handful of contest that
<br />
actually remember how I, or anyone else placed. What I do remember is that I
<br />
had a lot of fun along the way.
<br />
<br />As Kagan said indoor is intrinsically cool. I have had everyone from fine
<br />
art collectors to scientist and engineers express interest in my models. The
<br />
problem that we face is time it takes to become a proficient indoor flier. I
<br />
don't see this as a bad thing. Whether is playing and instrument or learning
<br />
snow ski, It takes time, money and commitment to get good at it. I think
<br />
that indoor as a whole will sustain itself as long as people long as people
<br />
keep going to contest / flying events and maintaining the open door policy
<br />
that the community has traditionally had at these events.
<br />
<br />What I think needs to stop happening is: All of us (and I'm guilty of this
<br />
as well) saying I'll make the next contest or I'll volunteer teach a group
<br />
of kids or work a contest next time. There will always be other things we
<br />
could be doing with our time but, if indoor is important enough of us to
<br />
have these indoor is dying conversations then indoor is worth donating the
<br />
time it took to type the email to a contest or a kid.
<br />
<br />Lastly, I think we should place the burden of starting indoor promoting
<br />
actives on people who don't currently fly. Guidance councilors have there
<br />
hands full with children whose parents are meeting their children's basic
<br />
needs. Teachers, especially public school teachers make all of 1000 dollars
<br />
a year before taxes for staying after two work with students after they have
<br />
already put in 8+ hours for the day. I know that personally, once quitting
<br />
time comes around the last thing I want to do is to stay at work anther 2-3
<br />
hours for free. While it would appear that this is a negative situation its
<br />
actually a positive situation for indoor mentors. Indoorist are able to say
<br />
to the schools, we'll come in and run an after school program at no cost to
<br />
the school if you'll give us a gym to fly in and a room to meet. As members
<br />
of the Oakland cloud dusters have found, this a profitable situation for all
<br />
involved.
<br />
<br />So please, put the time that you would be spending talking about why indoor
<br />
is dying into doing something to save it.
<br />
<br />Nick
