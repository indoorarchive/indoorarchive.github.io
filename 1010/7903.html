Bob (et al),
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I have also experienced that problem.  But I ask one question...how  did 
<br />
the local club do in nurturing themselves to those kids with a place to  take 
<br />
their interest?  That question isn't critical to anyone, but an  objective 
<br />
one.  I remember when I first found out that there was actually  an 
<br />
organization that liked free flight and actually had meetings and get  togethers and 
<br />
flying sessions and...well you get the picture.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
As having been part of that whole process, those participants need a place  
<br />
to go from being a high school S/O flyer to being an active flyer in the 
<br />
AMA or  the NFFS.  Those that did usually had a mentor or parent that guided 
<br />
them  along.  It's a big calling to take someone under their wing and make 
<br />
the  effort to be a mentor, and without that effort to keep the flame  
<br />
burning, today's kids usually fall back into the video game thing.   And, in these 
<br />
times if you approach a kid to offer a stepping stone you had  better go 
<br />
thru the parents.  We usually tell them go to this web site or  whatever and 
<br />
tell them something, but how much follow up is there to them with a  brochure, 
<br />
a club schedule, a designated person that follows up(?).  Very  little.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I also find it a bit puzzling in recent posts that there is an attitude  
<br />
that &quot;indoor is OK the way it is and does not need to change&quot; pushing for more 
<br />
&nbsp;difficult event classes.  But, the dichotomy is the success of  the pro-am 
<br />
event.  Why were the &quot;ams&quot; interested in that and not  rejecting it because 
<br />
they wanted to build an F1D? Well, because it was within  their reach.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
If one asks only of newcomers to build something that takes an inordinate  
<br />
amount of time to even get flying, it sort of defeats the purpose.  The  
<br />
minor leagues in baseball gets those guys capable of stepping into the major  
<br />
leagues...they just can't step up to the plate as a normal rookie and  start 
<br />
hitting home runs against a Roger Clemens...BTW...any relation?..and can  he 
<br />
get me any tickets? 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
True, there are some really great indoor flyers and I have had the  
<br />
privilege to fly with them, albeit my skills aren't up to theirs, but then  again, 
<br />
I am not a dedicated 100% indoor flyer.  I have many outdoor free  flight 
<br />
events on the plate too.  And like has been presented in the posts,  it is 
<br />
truly fascinating to watch John Kagan, Bill Gowen and Brett Sanborn  fly, but I 
<br />
don't want the only event I can enter to be F1D either.  I like  the CLG, 
<br />
Penny and F1L events...I can achieve them and still have  fun.  Indoor needs 
<br />
those &quot;dumbed down&quot; events to get the numbers out  and maybe then one can 
<br />
aspire to the full tilt EZB or F1D.  And, I  admit...at my age I need a mentor 
<br />
too.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
JMHO...

<br /><br /><br />Chris told us, &quot;Long story short, exposure  (to indoor flying) is the key.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I agree, but the actual results of  exposure to indoor modeling are dismal, 
<br />
at least where youngsters are  concerned. How many years have we exposed 
<br />
junior and senior high kids to  indoor flying via the Science Olympiad Right 
<br />
Stuff event plus balloon-launched  glider and soon the new helicopter event? 
<br />
Tens of thousands of students have  flown nationwide in SO competition over 
<br />
the years. Many, girls as well as  boys, built and flew their models very 
<br />
well indeed. As a mentor and event  director I've seen amazing strides made in 
<br />
SO flying events. I doubt any other  program have or ever will come close 
<br />
to the exposure level SO has  given our hobby. I've also given dozens of 
<br />
indoor flight demonstrations for  schools and Scout groups. Everyone in the many 
<br />
audiences is always amazed and  impressed. But how many of these kids have 
<br />
begun or continued in  full-fledged indoor flying/competition? A literal 
<br />
handful. Yes, a small  group of SO graduates have most certainly done very well 
<br />
for  themselves. But what of the other thousands? They are gone, probably 
<br />
never to  come back. That's a pretty poor return, from our standpoint, for 
<br />
the  effort many of us have expended in the SO movement. These days I'm  
<br />
flying and competing mostly outdoors. I see the same problem there, at  the same 
<br />
time realizing exposure of outdoor flying to potential  newcomers, young or 
<br />
old, is much more unlikely.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I believe the simply fact is that  model airplanes (as well as full scale 
<br />
aircraft and aviation in  general) of whatever type simply don't hold 
<br />
anywhere near the lure for  today's kids as they did- and still do for us . I doubt 
<br />
that this  lure can ever be recreated on any meaningful scale. We will get 
<br />
a few  kids plus some adult newcomers and returnees, but the glory days of 
<br />
our hobby,  indoors or out, are gone. We are a slowly dying breed, like it or 
<br />
not. I  plan to enjoy it as long as I can. Thankfully it will certainly  
<br />
outlive me.
