<br />
Tom,
<br />
<br />That's actually sightly worse than I had thought. I was going to leave the
<br />
point of making indoor activities alone because that goes so far against
<br />
indoor's open door policy that I thought it would be dismissed out right.
<br />
<br />When I was in middle school a SO mentor and indoor flier or some renowned
<br />
washed his hands of me because my middle school had no chance of making it
<br />
to SO nationals. I was disappointed by this as you can image. At that age I
<br />
was very enthusiastic for anything that flew. Thankfully, My mom made the
<br />
three hour drive once a month so I could fly with people like Bill Gowen,
<br />
Chris Goins and Steven Richmond. After I made the US junior team the mentor
<br />
in my home town that had wanted nothing to do with me became amicable again
<br />
and actually tired to claim credit for helping me to be successful.
<br />
<br />Of the handful of young indoor fliers I know, very few of them were
<br />
remarkable as kids. In fact, many of the best of them were awkward as kids,
<br />
and very introverted. I think that majority of us would have fallen through
<br />
the cracks of the education system if it wasn't for indoor and the
<br />
generosity of a few mentors.
<br />
<br />Indoor has the problem of being intrinsically exclusive due to the large
<br />
number of specialized skills required to build a completion model. I think
<br />
if we try to filter kids in anyway we will miss at least half of the kids
<br />
that would be interested and would benefit from the hobby. The kids at the
<br />
top of the selection process will have all kinds of opportunities to do
<br />
wonderful things because they have been recognized for being at the top of
<br />
their peers. Lets go after the kids that wouldn't be doing anything else. I
<br />
know that our goal is to perpetuate our hobby, but on some level the hobby
<br />
also changes the lives of the people who practice it.
<br />
<br />Lastly, I've flown in Lakehurst alone a few times, its very lonely. If take
<br />
I take only the &quot;chosen&quot; I'll be able to comfort myself when there are no
<br />
flying sites left with the fact I am one of a handful of people that can
<br />
pour microfilm or build a .4gram model. Where's the fun in that?
<br />
<br />Nick

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nick,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My recommendation for using guidance counselors and teachers was in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reference to selecting kids to be in a national competition AND NOT the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; training. Mentoring, training and timing can be done by anyone.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A guidance counselor at our high school has recommended kids to become a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Natural Helpers&quot;. Yea, I never heard of it before either but she read the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; info that came across her desk. Through a selection process 20 kids at our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; high school were chosen. It seems to be a neat opportunity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That guidance counselor HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TRAINING for Natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Helpers. All she did was help confirm the best kids for the opportunity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That was the format I suggested for the indoor national postal contest for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; students. Why not ask those in guidance, teaching, administration who know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the students' skills the best and allow them to make that positive contact?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tom
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Lastly, I think we should place the burden of starting indoor promoting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; actives on people who don't currently fly. Guidance councilors have there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; hands full with children whose parents are meeting their children's basic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; needs. Teachers, especially public school teachers make all of 1000
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dollars
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
