One thing that we are privilege to is the Colo Sp'gs auditorium does is put 
<br />
&nbsp;our activity on the marque on the main door.  We actually have had folks  
<br />
drop in for curiosity.  Again...lack of follow up...getting their names,  
<br />
etc.  Our bad...
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
What about a newspaper article on the next upcoming event or an ad in the  
<br />
&quot;what's happening&quot; part of the newspaper.  Some people actually read that  
<br />
from what I hear.  Marketing is a whole facet of stuff...and guess who  is a 
<br />
marketing guy?  Don DeLoach...our club is lucky to have  him.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;We.&quot; the modeling community don't market ourselves very well...we just  
<br />
think we only need to call our flying buddy and those who read this web  group.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The MMM club has been very fortunate in that we are actually growing with  
<br />
new members as a result of our &quot;marketing&quot; by way of word of mouth, NFFS,  
<br />
AMA, etc.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
'nuff said....

<br /><br />Neil,
<br />
<br />Implimentation maybe bigger than just the indoor  community. NFFS should 
<br />
see an opportunity and take advantage of this and offer  both organizational 
<br />
and investment backing. 
<br />
<br />As for ceiling hgts, other  postals have a factoring system that works so 
<br />
its not rocket science. But, a  30' ceiling limit can be used as most HS gyms 
<br />
fit that parameter.
<br />
<br />There  will always be the unique kid who just loves indoor and freeflight 
<br />
as a whole.  Most kids are influenced by their peers as to what is &quot;cool&quot; and 
<br />
what isn't.  What I suggest stands, give a kid a tangible reason to be 
<br />
interested that  raises his/her social position, you will get their committment.
<br />
<br />Ikara  props level the playing field. That's been proven with SO many times 
<br />
over. On  a national basis, leveling the field is needed as the scope of 
<br />
the competition  already leads to high performance issues. 
<br />
<br />We need to have an open  perspective. I am not expecting a glut of new 
<br />
fliers. What I do want is  EXPOSURE to the sport. BTW, my second daughter did 
<br />
extremely well in SO and  went to nationals 7 years straight. She built 
<br />
bridges, towers and built/flew  and then won Wright Stuff in DC. She's a sophmore 
<br />
at Purdue in mechanical  engineering. She also has a co-op now with General 
<br />
Electric in KY. She was  selected by GE because of the bridges and not the 
<br />
flying. Our sport simply has  an identity problem!! We are very low on the 
<br />
Radar screen.
