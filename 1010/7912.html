John,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I too don't think it needs a makeover, but then again we just can't sit  
<br />
back and be &quot;pro-centric&quot; about the hobby either.  My whole thing for the  
<br />
past 30 years is promoting new blood.  One can't always forget  that.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Flying sites are really a bugaboo...I have to give Don D a lot of credit  
<br />
for promoting indoor here in Colorado...he's the guy who got us the Colo 
<br />
Spg's  auditorium, and some good things are on the horizon.  But, if it wasn't 
<br />
for  Don promoting it to me and offering the opportunity, I would be the 
<br />
1/16&quot; sq  stringer kind of flyer.  I followed my daughter thru TSA (like  S/O) 
<br />
Colo state champ to 2nd at the Nationals in Chicago.  The next  step was 
<br />
provided by Don with my willingness to drive to Colorado Springs.   Fortunately, 
<br />
I was all for it...Cass got interrupted with college and  soccer.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
That sort of reinforces my point though....everywhere there is an  
<br />
interested indoor flyer, one can't expect them to make the drive to Johnson City  
<br />
for their only experience.  In the realm of a beginner, there is the what,  
<br />
where, and why.  Make it too difficult and the interest wanes.   Yeah, there 
<br />
are a few that do it anyway, those folks who just jump into it  whole hog, 
<br />
but in general it's a big marketing job.  There is a hobby shop  near me that 
<br />
promotes RC car racing...so...they built a track in the parking lot  and 
<br />
promoted it that way.  The turnout is tremendous where there was nobody  last 
<br />
year.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
My indoor growth was started with Sweeny Hayashi here in Denver.   He got 
<br />
his local church to generously allow us to fly in their huge gym  once a 
<br />
month.  Since I was an outdoor guy with a curiosity, I built a  P-Nut using 
<br />
1/20th sq instead of 1/16 and had a blast...then on to Mace  P-24.  Through 
<br />
Don's efforts, a Penny and on to an EZB boosted by Tim  Goldstein pressuring me 
<br />
to fly a &quot;really true&quot; indoor model...the Hobby  Shopper...then  and 
<br />
then..well, who knows what.  BUT, I had  mentors...
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The monkey falls on our backs to pick up the baton and keep the race  
<br />
going.  That's where a guy like Don D comes in.  He has literally  quadrupled the 
<br />
indoor interest in Colorado...an &quot;A&quot; for effort.  One may  not agree with 
<br />
his thoughts, but new thoughts are what generates  growth.

<br />Hi  Rick,
<br />
<br />I'm one of the ones who believe that Indoor FF doesn't need a  21st century 
<br />
makeover to become cool or appealing.  It already is cool  and appealing.  
<br />
It's not like we're the Society of Butter Churners, or  whatever the heck 
<br />
else they did in the old days.  We just need to make  more people aware of it, 
<br />
and give them a way to join.
<br />
<br />You are spot on  about SO.  It's a fifty thousand person Indoor FF 
<br />
recruiting  opportunity.  Right now, about 49,990 don't know we exist.  We can't  
<br />
sit back and consider SO to be their exposure to Indoor.
<br />
<br />I did a  demonstration before the awards ceremony at a local SO regional 
<br />
last  year.  Nothing major, just a 5 minute flight and a rambling speech on 
<br />
the  microphone.  When I was done, about twenty kids and coaches came down  
<br />
from the bleachers to talk and ask questions.  I handed out sheets with  
<br />
Internet resources and such.  Just the other day I ran across a thread on  one of 
<br />
the SO sites from a kid who was there asking about Indoor FF and how to  
<br />
get into it.
<br />
<br />Exposure works.  And your point about giving them the  rest of the path to 
<br />
start is just as important.  This includes getting  flying sites (definitely 
<br />
a catch-22 with participation levels) and having  self-start resources 
<br />
available.
<br />
<br />It also requires beginner events, like  the ones you mentioned you enjoy 
<br />
flying.  Which brings up the recurring  topic of how to keep beginner events 
<br />
appealing to beginners.   
<br />
<br />Rather than complaining about how experts always ruin beginner events,  
<br />
Buxton, DeLoach, and I came up with the idea of the LPP Pro/Am.  On it's  first 
<br />
try we had 25 sign up and 15 actually show up and  participate.
<br />
<br />How many will continue?  J.P. Kish was so  enthusiastic about his 
<br />
experience, if he doesn't return next year with his own  LPP I'll eat my hat.  
<br />
Elizabeth He has been shanghaied by the Tysons and  will possibly become the first 
<br />
girl to make the Junior F1D team.  Ken  Achee has been hooked.  The list 
<br />
goes on.
<br />
<br />Indoor FF is not going  to die, so we can quit lamenting.  It's not a good 
<br />
look anyway â€“ who  wants to take up an activity whose own participants think 
<br />
is boring, old, and  about to expire.
<br />
<br />We do, however, have the power to increase our  numbers.  Which will make 
<br />
it more fun, and help with things like getting  sites to fly in.
<br />
<br />Also, let's quit bashing &quot;expert&quot; events, like the  proposed 1/2A.  
<br />
Beginner events are the path, and expert events are the  lure.  If Delta Darts had 
<br />
been my only exposure to Indoor FF, I wouldn't  be here writing this  today.
