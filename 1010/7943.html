Great!!!   Advertising is another means too...let the public  
<br />
know...advertise in the S/O classes, etc.
<br />
We have a lot of S/O advisors with their kids show up at our indoor  
<br />
sessions.  We open the doors and us old guys provide help to the kids and  models 
<br />
for the parents too.  Our knowledge is helpful to them and they  appreciate 
<br />
it.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The key is followup.

<br />Bob,  Rick et al-
<br />
<br />You guys are all correct. Having SO as an introduction has  been an asset. 
<br />
Certainly in some geographic areas (in Ohio for instance)  became 
<br />
&quot;mini-hotbeds&quot; due to efforts of many enthusiasts (John Kagen, the late  Doc Hacker 
<br />
and others). We have had this discussion many times at AMA Ed  committee 
<br />
meetings and I even drew up a list of observations but no specific  solutions. 
<br />
Here's a couple of those having to do with middle school and high  school age 
<br />
youth...
<br />
<br />1) Youth involvement is directly proportional to  &quot;bragging rights&quot; (ie: 
<br />
does my involvement raise my status with my peers, my  girl/guy friend?)
<br />
<br />2) Is this activity something that will get me into a  good college, is 
<br />
there any money to earn?
<br />
<br />3) How much time does my  involvement consume? I have lot's of homework, 
<br />
band, sports, Science Olympiad,  Choir, etc. etc.
<br />
<br />Earning something of value is what gets the attention  of either mom and 
<br />
dad or their son and daughter. &quot;Money&quot; would get the most  attention but its 
<br />
hard to come by. So what other incentives are  there?
<br />
<br />Here are some ideas...
<br />
<br />A) A national postal event with a  running tally on the NFFS website. A 
<br />
simple design with an adult sign-off  (non-related) to allow for  posting 
<br />
official times. That organization can  be evoloved security wise over time. This 
<br />
means that a student may show their  buddies that he has been offically 
<br />
acknowledged-NATIONALLY- that's bragging  rights! AWARD the top 10%.
<br />
<br />B) Contact technically driven universities  with such a program idea and 
<br />
sell them on offering scholarships. They don't  need to be a lot in $'s but 
<br />
now a student gets bragging rights for earning  &quot;money&quot;.
<br />
<br />C) Pick design parameters that are relatively simplistic to  start. An SO 
<br />
airplane is still to complex. The commercial plastic prop should  be strongly 
<br />
considered to ease the divisions of performance.
<br />
<br />D)  Marketing the ideas, that's the challenge. We can discuss this process  
<br />
ad-nauseum. I believe a promotion geared towards schools and especially  
<br />
guidance councilors, math, science and technology teachers is the link. Have  
<br />
them select a few students. Make the opportunity LIMITED in each school, 
<br />
that  drives desire and competition. 
<br />
<br />The bottomline is that indoor is not  for everybody but there are many who 
<br />
would flourish. Get the nerds and  engineering types a tangible goal. Make 
<br />
sure that they at least get a  certificate and a unique &quot;letter&quot; for 
<br />
participation for their letter jacket  (many schools now allow lettering for 
<br />
academics as well).     
<br />
<br />Be realistic and do not expect students to continue flying their whole  
<br />
life especially just after they leave school. But stay in touch, if possible,  
<br />
let them get independent, families started, homes bought, etc,  etc.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bob (et al),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have also  experienced that problem.  But I ask one question...how  did 
</em><br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the local club do in nurturing themselves to those kids with a place  to  
</em><br />
take 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their interest?  That question isn't critical to  anyone, but an  
</em><br />
objective 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one.  I remember when I first  found out that there was actually  an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organization that liked  free flight and actually had meetings and get  
</em><br />
togethers and 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  flying sessions and...well you get the picture.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As  having been part of that whole process, those participants need a 
</em><br />
place   
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to go from being a high school S/O flyer to being an active flyer in  the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AMA or  the NFFS.  Those that did usually had a mentor  or parent that 
</em><br />
guided 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them  along.  It's a big calling to  take someone under their wing and 
</em><br />
make 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the  effort to be a  mentor, and without that effort to keep the flame  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; burning,  today's kids usually fall back into the video game thing.   
</em><br />
And, in  these 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times if you approach a kid to offer a stepping stone you  had  better go 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thru the parents.  We usually tell them go  to this web site or  whatever 
</em><br />
and 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tell them something, but how  much follow up is there to them with a  
</em><br />
brochure, 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a club  schedule, a designated person that follows up(?).  Very   little.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I also find it a bit puzzling in recent posts  that there is an attitude  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that &quot;indoor is OK the way it is and  does not need to change&quot; pushing 
</em><br />
for more 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  difficult event  classes.  But, the dichotomy is the success of  the 
</em><br />
pro-am 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  event.  Why were the &quot;ams&quot; interested in that and not  rejecting it  
</em><br />
because 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they wanted to build an F1D? Well, because it was  within  their reach.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If one asks only of newcomers  to build something that takes an 
</em><br />
inordinate  
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amount of time to  even get flying, it sort of defeats the purpose.  The  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  minor leagues in baseball gets those guys capable of stepping into the  
</em><br />
major  
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leagues...they just can't step up to the plate as a  normal rookie and  
</em><br />
start 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hitting home runs against a Roger  Clemens...BTW...any relation?..and can 
</em><br />
&nbsp;he 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get me any tickets?  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; True, there are some really great indoor flyers and I  have had the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; privilege to fly with them, albeit my skills  aren't up to theirs, but 
</em><br />
then  again, 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not a dedicated 100%  indoor flyer.  I have many outdoor free  
</em><br />
flight 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events on  the plate too.  And like has been presented in the posts,  it 
</em><br />
is  
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truly fascinating to watch John Kagan, Bill Gowen and Brett  Sanborn  
</em><br />
fly, but I 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't want the only event I can enter to be  F1D either.  I like  the 
</em><br />
CLG, 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Penny and F1L events...I can  achieve them and still have  fun.  Indoor 
</em><br />
needs 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those  &quot;dumbed down&quot; events to get the numbers out  and maybe then one 
</em><br />
can  
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aspire to the full tilt EZB or F1D.  And, I  admit...at my  age I need a 
</em><br />
mentor 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chris told us, &quot;Long story short, exposure  (to indoor flying)  is the 
</em><br />
key.&quot;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree, but the actual results of   exposure to indoor modeling are 
</em><br />
dismal, 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at least where youngsters  are  concerned. How many years have we exposed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; junior and senior  high kids to  indoor flying via the Science Olympiad 
</em><br />
Right 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stuff  event plus balloon-launched  glider and soon the new helicopter 
</em><br />
event?  
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tens of thousands of students have  flown nationwide in SO  competition 
</em><br />
over 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the years. Many, girls as well as  boys, built  and flew their models 
</em><br />
very 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well indeed. As a mentor and event   director I've seen amazing strides 
</em><br />
made in 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SO flying events. I doubt  any other  program have or ever will come 
</em><br />
close 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the exposure  level SO has  given our hobby. I've also given dozens of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indoor  flight demonstrations for  schools and Scout groups. Everyone in 
</em><br />
the many  
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; audiences is always amazed and  impressed. But how many of these  kids 
</em><br />
have 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; begun or continued in  full-fledged indoor  flying/competition? A literal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; handful. Yes, a small  group of SO  graduates have most certainly done 
</em><br />
very well 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for  themselves.  But what of the other thousands? They are gone, 
</em><br />
probably 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never  to  come back. That's a pretty poor return, from our standpoint, 
</em><br />
for  
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the  effort many of us have expended in the SO movement. These  days I'm  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flying and competing mostly outdoors. I see the same  problem there, at  
</em><br />
the same 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time realizing exposure of outdoor  flying to potential  newcomers, young 
</em><br />
or 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; old, is much more  unlikely.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I believe the simply fact is that  model  airplanes (as well as full 
</em><br />
scale 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aircraft and aviation in   general) of whatever type simply don't hold 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anywhere near the lure  for  today's kids as they did- and still do for 
</em><br />
us . I doubt 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  that this  lure can ever be recreated on any meaningful scale. We will  
</em><br />
get 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a few  kids plus some adult newcomers and returnees, but the  glory days 
</em><br />
of 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our hobby,  indoors or out, are gone. We are a  slowly dying breed, like 
</em><br />
it or 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not. I  plan to enjoy it as long  as I can. Thankfully it will certainly  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outlive  me.
