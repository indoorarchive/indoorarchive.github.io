<br />
This is the kick-off of a social experiment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Stan Chilton is retiring from Indoor FF.  For those who don’t know him, Stan was an Indoor powerhouse, known for his extremely precise approach to building and flying (you may have accurate jigs, but do you build on a granite block that required a crane to place in your workshop?)  David Aronstein has written a nice biography of Stan’s accomplishments that you can see below.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Stan has a collection of valuable Indoor supplies, tools, and other supporting paraphernalia that he wants to go to people who will use and appreciate them.  My personal observation of recent similar distributions is that either the first person contacted quickly grabs everything (as I was tempted), or someone with cash to spare makes a closed-door deal for the whole lot.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;There is nothing really wrong with that process – and it seems to work out well for the person offering the goods – but it got me wondering if there was another way to reach a larger audience while still providing appropriate benefit to the seller.  This could help get more people involved in Indoor, get the people already involved building and flying more, and overall be good Karma. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;After pondering some different approaches, I talked Stan and David Aronstein (who is the helping Stan) into trying this experiment.  There will be a different method for each of several groups of items.  I am open to suggestions for modifying the processes, and I expect almost everyone to have an opinion (and Leo to have several J), but there will probably only be changes for glaring problems or for something that will make a dramatic improvement.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;The first set of items include rolls of Y2K/Y2K2, 2 Wilder winders, a Leeson stripper, 2 Ferdie Uban torque meters, and some other items.  It also includes an outdoor Wilder winder that should go through a similar process with the Outdoor crowd (Don D, message heading your way soon).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;The price Stan is asking for each item is listed, with pictures, in a separate document that I have uploaded to the files section in the Indoor Construction Yahoo group, and hopefully have attached in the Hip Pocket forum.  The prices are very reasonable. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;The process for the first set of items will be:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;-        Nominations solicited from the community, along with a discussion of why the nominee is worthy.  You can nominate yourself, or someone else.
<br />
&nbsp;-        Yahoo Groups poll created with all the nominees
<br />
&nbsp;-        Voting (you can vote for more than one nominee)
<br />
&nbsp;-        Top nominee offered an opportunity to purchase one item
<br />
&nbsp;-        Work down the list until all items are sold
<br />
&nbsp;-        Ties (such as a group of nominees with 1 vote) settled via a raffle website like www.randompicker.com <a href="http://www.randompicker.com/">http://www.randompicker.com/</a>
<br />
&nbsp;-        Leftover items offered on eBay
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;We are going to start with the rolls of film (8 rolls of Y2K ($100 each), 5 rolls of Y2K2 ($100 each), 3 rolls of Polymicro 2L ($25 each), and some partial rolls and remnants).  Discussion and nominations begin now.  Poll closes on January 8 2016 .
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;I nominate Max Zaluska for a roll of Y2K/Y2K2 so that he can build another Hand Launch Stick and complete his quest for an hour+ flight.  Max flew over 58 minutes at Lakehurst during the Labor Day contest before losing his plane in an irretrievable spot on the wall (which is so unlike Max)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;The second set of items includes boxes of tools and supplies, books and plans, and scales and other equipment.  These will be posted on eBay and announced on this list.  This will work like the Storage Wars TV show – you get a photo of the box contents and as complete a description as possible, offer what you think is a good deal, and look for some great treasures.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;The last item is Stan’s collection of cut Indoor wood.  He and David wanted to clear this out as one unit, so I have purchased it and will re-sell individual sheets.  My goal is to get the wood into as many hands as possible, so that it can become as many models as possible (rather than it all just sitting in one workshop).  More info to follow.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;From David Aronstein:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;“If you have been flying Indoor since ~2005 or earlier, you probably know Stan already, or know of him.  If you do not, here is a brief introduction.  The purpose is not to boast, but to let you know that his tools, materials and equipment are absolutely first-rate.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Stan Chilton is best known as a highly competitive Indoor Free Flight modeler but has also flown Outdoor Free Flight and Control Line in earlier years (back to the 1950s).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;His modeling accomplishments include, but are by no means limited to[1]:
<br />
&nbsp;·        Model of the Year - 1983 and 1990
<br />
&nbsp;·        Author of “Chilton’s Corner” column in Indoor News and Views (INAV)
<br />
&nbsp;·        Author of “Packing In The Turns,” a classic and definitive article on winding techniques
<br />
&nbsp;·        Has designs in Indoor Winning Designs 2002-2005
<br />
&nbsp;·        41 National and World indoor records between 1965 and 2005, most recently:
<br />
&nbsp;o       CAT 1 Mini-Stick, 11:13 , in Wichita in 2002 (still stands)
<br />
&nbsp;o       CAT III F1L, 22:32 , at West Baden in 2004
<br />
&nbsp;o       CAT 1 F1L, 16:05 , in 2005
<br />
&nbsp;·        Free Flight Hall of Fame (2014)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;In addition, he is a World War II Veteran (Army paratrooper) and husband of Judy for 70 years (so far).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;For a more comprehensive introduction, please see the National Free Flight Society’s Symposium 2014.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Parkinson’s disease has curtailed his modeling activities and he is now looking to hand off most of his materials, tools and supplies to people who will make good use of them.  A portion of the proceeds from items sold will be donated to the National Free Flight Society’s Indoor fund.”
