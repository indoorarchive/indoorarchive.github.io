Oh, been reading some messages lurking last few years. It was neat to hear some people like Ben for instance get back into flying after college.  Doug has been extremely busy in grad school at Penn in Philadelphia. He keeps talking about going to Lakehurst (Did once during National Finals just for fun) but goes to CERN collider over in Switzerland for large portion of summers for work.   
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year built one of those 5 gram helicopters thought what the heck wanted to see if such a monster weight would actually lift off floor. It wasn’t anything special as blades were made on bucket…….never have figured out how exactly to carve block for helical effect.  It did 1:23 and little girl whom made her own was just under minute. It was fun but there’s seems to be some magic lost because of the extreme weight or maybe it’s the short duration compared to WS plane.  Did mathematical comparison F1D and PP to WS models then used same ratio to Indoor Helicopter to his trail event/. Wow, forget the numbers exactly but it was something in area double triple normal WS plane weights.   Every now and then help whatever school might ask.

<br />&nbsp;What is the &quot;Pro-Am&quot; all about and who in general are &quot;Ams&quot; that signed up where are they coming from?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Thanks

<br />
<br /><br />I want to make sure the Pro-Am is a worthwhile experience for the Ams, and a major part of that is making sure there are enough Pros to go around.
<br />
<br />DeLoach has suggested various forms of advertising, and Kang has gone one better and offered to spread the word to the SO lists on which he is active.
<br />
<br />My current inclination is to accept the Ams that are trickling in from the existing advertising, but put the kabosh on more aggressive recruiting - for this round anyway. I don't want the event collapse under the weight of its own success. I'm happy to say that it looks like it could easily head that way.
<br />
<br />We have 19 Ams so far, and are about 5 Pros short. Sanborn is the lastest addition. Who else wants to join the fun?
<br />
