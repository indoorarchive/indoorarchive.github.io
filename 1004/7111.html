I did my first attempts to practice steering yesterday. The local 
<br />
football hall is only 18 metres, so it was not too high, but I suppose 
<br />
it is better to start practice with a easier task. It will be hard 
<br />
enough in Belgrade in August...
<br />
<br />So a few comments to the responses that I got from John several months ago:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't have enough info. The only times I've gotten on the right side

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But getting in on the left side has always been fairly easy unless it is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; near the end of the flight. Getting on the prop too soon is problematic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too, BTW. It usually results in breaking the outline and ribs at the hub.

<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;

<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; I get on the left side of the motorstick primarily so that the model

<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; doesn't try to turn off the line as I move forward. I assume this is

<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; the reason others do it, too. Unless the model is near the end of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; flight – and very low on power – the props seems to get past the line
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; pretty neatly when I come in from the left side of the prop.
</em><br />
<br />Agreed. Even though my previous conclusions about prop turning direction 
<br />
suggested the right side, it actually turned out to be much easier from 
<br />
the left. Actually, from neither side could I really make the model &quot;fly 
<br />
the prop&quot; past the foam rod, but rather had to come in from the left, 
<br />
between the prop and wing. Which of course was a little hard, if you did 
<br />
not time to move right, you only hit the wing tip and got the model bump 
<br />
out of the rod. As you can easily see on the vid.
<br />
<br />Another thing was that I did not find it too easy to engage the prop, 
<br />
but pulling forward tended to pull the rod past the prop blades. 
<br />
Constantly turning to the right, to get some pressure against the motor 
<br />
tube helped somewhat, but still it was a delicate balance moving forward 
<br />
fast enough to keep the prop engaged, and not moving too fast to pull 
<br />
the rod in front of the prop altogether. I guess I just need more 
<br />
practice...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; I use a 3' Qualatex balloon inflated tightly. The pull and drag
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; combine to make it reasonably maneuverable. There is nothing much as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; frustrating as trying to steer with a flat balloon. It takes way too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; long for it to react, and it's very hard to catch and move the model.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; The higher you try to steer, the more the lag gets in the way. But the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; 3' balloons have worked for me at the top of Lakehurst and Akron.
</em><br />
<br />I was using an 80cm rubber balloon. The only reason to pick this size 
<br />
was that it was the largest one that fits the trunk of my car. I do not 
<br />
have a helium bottle, it would be way too expensive to buy or rent one 
<br />
for a single balloon, thus the only practical solution is to get one 
<br />
from the balloon shop filled. Luckily, the 80 cm balloon was quite large 
<br />
enough to give solid pull on the steering rod. I measured about 100 
<br />
grams of lift from it. As a matter of fact, on one flight I put a camera 
<br />
on, it weights about 20 grams, so even 80 grams of lift turned out to be 
<br />
sufficient for the steering. FWIW, a large mylar balloon provides 75 
<br />
grams of lift, so even that one might work for the purpose....
<br />
<br />The vid? Yes, I taped a small kaychain camera to the top of the foam 
<br />
rod. Unfortunately there is a short lenght of string between the balloon 
<br />
and the rod, and this allowed the camera to rotate quite freely. Next 
<br />
time I should tape the camera to the balloon itself... Anyways, got some 
<br />
aerial footage of my steering attemps:
