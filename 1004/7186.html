Bill,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This invitation goes to all Wright Stuff participants, students
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coaches, mentors, and parents. It is all of you who have made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wright Stuff the great event it has been over the years.
</em><br />
<br />I may have used the term &quot;invitational&quot; in a historical SO context that I did not intend. But does the wording of the post at the SO forum sound like it's for &quot;elites&quot; only?  It is definitely not intended that way.
<br />
<br />I will be happy to reword the post to reflect that it is for all those interested.
<br />
<br />-Kang

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The term &quot;invitational&quot; makes my blood boil. This term normally means that only people who get &quot;invited&quot; can participate. The first time there was Wright Stuff at USIC it was run as an &quot;invitational&quot; and none of my kids were invited. The reason I was given for this is that the &quot;invitiers&quot; didn't want a crowd of kids running around disturbing the &quot;serious&quot; flyers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe Carl has some other definition of &quot;invitational&quot; but this is what SO invitational matches are usually about - the kids that someone considers &quot;elite&quot; get invited and a lot of others who might be interested and qualified don't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am totally opposed to this idea.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   I posted the following at the Science Olympiad forum. I've been discussing this with Carl, and he wanted to make the Wright Stuff event an &quot;invitational.&quot; WS participants fly free.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Many of you have been involved with Science Olympiad over the years. This year is the last year of Wright Stuff for some time -- so let's give it a proper send-off. Bring your WS 2009/2010 plane and compete against students, coaches, mentors. You never know -- may be you will encourage a future World Champion or a future indoor die-heart.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Another reason: Leo has posted a high watermark of 5:11 at Tustin, and he thinks he can do 6:00.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   ====================================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Students, Coaches, Mentors, Parents,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   You are invited to participate in the Wright Stuff Invitational at the AMA Nationals, US Indoor Championship, in Johnson City, TN on May 28 and 29, 2010. Whether you are a competitive or fun flyer, come and join your fellow Wright Stuff flyers and coaches from around the country and give Wright Stuff a great send-off. You will learn a thing or two. You will have a blast. You will meet many others who share in your interest for Wright Stuff.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   You will compete in a premier flying site that annually holds the AMA Nationals, US Indoor Championship. The ceiling height is 120'. The competition will be serious, but in a fun and casual atmosphere. Bring your current plane. Or if you are daring, build a new one more suited for high ceilings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   All Wright Stuff participants will forgo the usual AMA Nationals entry fee and compete for free. Wright Stuff flying will take place over two days, on the mornings of May 28 and 29, 2010.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Come and meet those who have participated in this forum. It will be good to put a face to the words.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Perhaps you are a competitive Wright Stuff flyer but your team did not make to the States or to the Nationals. This is your chance to continue your flying.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Perhaps you are the State champion, or the National champion. Come and compete against those Wright Stuff flyers who might give you even stiffer competition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Perhaps you are interested in continuing your indoor flying to the next level. Come and learn from the best. You will meet the best indoor flyers from around the country -- people who are US and World Champions. People who have been flying indoor models for 50 years, and others who are beginners.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   You may also want to build a pennyplane or F1L EZB and compete in other events. Do it. If you have the will, you can do it. All experts were beginners at one time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   This invitation goes to all Wright Stuff participants, students, coaches, mentors, and parents. It is all of you who have made Wright Stuff the great event it has been over the years.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   For information and questions, please contact the 2010 AMA Nationals, USIC Contest Director Carl Bakay carl.bakay_at_...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   I will also answer any questions you have on this forum.
