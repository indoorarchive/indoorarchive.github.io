<br />
Tim,
<br />
<br />I can tell you I will not just give a person advice if none is asked 
<br />
for. Not because I don't think a person deserves it or that person is 
<br />
looked down upon, but because some people take offense to advice being 
<br />
given when not asked for and when motors are breaking and things are 
<br />
going wrong at a contest and frustration sets in I know the last thing I 
<br />
want at times is some person chiming in and giving me their $.02 . Maybe 
<br />
I am funny that way, but I know our group of guys will gladly help 
<br />
anyone who asks but the key is ask. I don't mean you have to ask because 
<br />
we get a power trip from it, we want you to ask because we know you are 
<br />
OK with hearing suggestions or advice, I don't want to stick my nose 
<br />
into someone else's business if it is not wanted, and I think most 
<br />
indoor guys are like that. We have a guy locally with a LPP. He does 4-5 
<br />
minutes and has the same model for 10-15 years, does not want to fly 
<br />
longer he is happy with that and all the warps and wobbling prop it has. 
<br />
So I tend to let people be at any contest I am at.
<br />
<br />Recently I did a build thread on Hippocket on a laser cut Nocal kit from 
<br />
Volare products. George (owner of Volare Products) wanted an indoor 
<br />
nocal kit to sell, and he has seen us for many years fly long nocal 
<br />
times. So we collaborated and I detailed what had to be done step by 
<br />
step, and George who use to only get 2 to 2:30 in Nocal went passed 3 
<br />
minutes, 4 minutes , and now is flying 5 minutes in a 50 ft site. How 
<br />
did this all start? He emailed me and asked how he can improve his 
<br />
nocals. His first iteration was 6 grams the second was around 4 grams. I 
<br />
think the indoor community is actually very good in information sharing 
<br />
but the key is you do have to ask to get it. Otherwise we think you are 
<br />
happy what you are doing so we will leave you alone to do your thing.
<br />
<br />On the opposite end of this, there was a recent local Science Olympiad 
<br />
invitational, and the kid whose model flew the longest, once her model 
<br />
landed, ran out to  the middle of the floor with a box to cover the 
<br />
plane so no other team could see it :)
