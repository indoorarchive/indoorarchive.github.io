Tim,
<br />
<br /><br />What's your address? I'll send you some 4/5lb indoor wood. What sizes do you need?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The beauty of indoor is that you can make it whatever want.  You can choose to spend big bucks on the best wood and best rubber, and if you work hard enough, you will be competitive.  You can also choose to spend less money on wood and rubber, and if you take the time to pick the best of the wood you have, and the best of the rubber you have (or bum a few feet of the good stuff from a friend) and you work hard enough, you will be competitive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have noticed there is an attitude by some modelers out there that indoor should be easy, and when those individuals find out it isn't, they whine about how hard it is, try to change the rules to make it easier for them (while not realizing it will also make it easier for the really good flyers as well...the 6.2g NoCal rule comes to mind) or simply give up flying indoor.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For the quitters out there, I don't know what to say.  I guess this is a hobby and if it's too hard and no longer fun, then I understand not doing it anymore.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But for those that stick with it, appreciate that to be really good at indoor, it takes dedication and hard work.  One cannot simply walk into an indoor contest with their first model ever and expect to set a record.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you look at the current list of &quot;who's who&quot; in indoor aeromodeling, you will see the vast majority of them have years, sometimes even decades of experience.  That experience is what makes them the best.  It's not their balsa, or their rubber, but rather what they are capable of doing with their balsa and rubber that separates the experts from the beginners.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But here's the rub.  All of the experts out there ! are more than willing to help the beginners progress to expert level.  Beginners just need to listen to the advice they are given, execute that advice, and then record what they did.  Though I have noticed far too many beginners do not want to heed the advice of more experienced flyers, preferring to learn it all on their own.  I guess there is something to that, but it's definitely the long and hard road.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I do not begrudge Greenman for not having a website at all. I know that it takes a lot of time to maintain that sort of thing and that's not what he is into. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; He is providing top-quality balsa for a very select number of fliers and I'm sure that just maintaining email contact keeps him plenty busy. I appreciate you giving back to the indoor community as you have in the past years. A to Z supply and you enabled me to get back in to indoor flying a few years ago and I really appreciate it. For the most part however indoor flying has become a very expensive and bewildering Easter egg hunt.
