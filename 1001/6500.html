Bill,
<br />
This is a good example of &quot;unintended consequences&quot;. 
<br />
I have tried 15 sq. in. stabs, larger stabs &amp; smaller stabs. I know I have seen A6 rules with a limit on stab size, but I cannot tell you where. Mark Bennet pointed out that Don's rules do not require the prop to be make out of wood, thus opening up the possibility of using foam. Every time someone tries to improve the rules it has an impact on someone else. Initially, I thought making A6 an AMA event was a good thing. Now I am not sure. The clearest set of rules I am aware of are the Indoor Construction set. I suggest you review them &amp; if you agree, adopt them as the USIC rules. I do not believe they will obsolete anyone's A6. Since the AMA proposal is now in motion we must decide whether to oppose it, accept it or amend it. I will oppose or ammend it, if it allows foam for the prop.

<br />
<br /><br />Now I have a problem. I emailed Don about the 50% stab and he said he would not remove that rule. The USIC rules and the &quot;national rules&quot; do not have this stab area restriction. My personal A-6 design has a 24 si stab. Changing to a 15 si stab would probably mean designing a new model.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
To confuse matters more I looked at all of the A-6 designs on Jeff Hood's website and found that all of the stabs were under 15 si.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Am I the only A-6 flyer that is not in line with this non-existent rule? If this rule has been used in the past why was it dropped for USIC and the &quot;national rules&quot;?

<br />
A6 flyers,
<br />
<br />The new A6 rule set reportedly submitted to AMA by Don DeLoach contains at least two substantive differences with the &quot;2006 A6 Committee&quot; rules (available in InCo Files section.) The DDL new rules copied here below.
<br />
<br />Notice the prop rule (#8) where the specification &quot;wood&quot; has been deleted. This would allow use of foam for prop blades or whatever else. To back this up, in his rule #10, the general high tech material prohibition and specific foam prohibition has been deleted, compared with 2006 A6 Committee rule set.
<br />
<br />Also notice rule #2--a new thing for A6--where tail area is limited to 50% Some of you would need new stab.
<br />
<br />For all I know, many affected A6 flyers have been contacted by DDL for collaboration, input, feedback about this new rule set. IF SO, please enjoy your new A6. (PS, it takes two rounds of AMA voting, so this won't happen overnight.) 
<br />
JMO,
<br />
Mark F1diddler 
<br />
<br />A6 rules reportedly submitted to AMA for event status:
<br />

<br />
<br />3. All wing and stab outlines shall be 1/16: square minimum, corners left square/unsanded.
<br />
<br />4. Wing posts 1/16 square (ends may be rounded for inserting into paper tubes).
<br />
<br />5. Motor stick: 6â€ long maximum (measured from the front thrust bearing face
<br />
<br />to the front of the rear hook).
<br />
<br />6. Cambered ribs are acceptable but must be cut from 1/32â€ balsa sheet. Rib depth must be 1/16&quot; minimum.
<br />
<br />7. Weight: 1.2 grams minimum without rubber.
<br />
<br />8. Propeller 6 inch maximum diameter. Blades to be flat 1/32 sheet. (No camber/forming). No thinning of blade thickness and all edges must be left square.
