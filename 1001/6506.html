Don, 
<br />
I must strongly disagree with the statement that allowing plastic is a minor issue. To repeat myself, A6 is an entry level indoor duration event. I think everyone would agree that was Clarence Mather's intent, as evidenced by the restrictions on wood sizes, flat bladed props, covering material, etc. Covering with paper is not at all difficult. It may be different from covering with plastic but it isn't difficult. If you want to fly a 1.2 gram plastic covered duration event you already have F1L. Look what has happened to EZB &amp; AROG as a consequence of rules changes. What are the unintended consequences of allowing plastic? We don't know do we? I can imagine that all the weight saved by the use of lighter covering could be used to extend the tail boom to 20+ inches combined with a much smaller stab. A result that might make A6 less inviting to beginners. I called Emil Schutzel &amp; Tem Johnson (both fly events that allow plastic) to get their view on this. I didn't try to influence them. They are much more upset by this change than I am. 
<br />
A6 is unique in indoor duration and quite popular. It should be left as is. Do not mess with success.

A-6 has a very good rules set. The weight target is reasonable and prop definition and wood sizes are well-targeted to beginners. The only (minor) question we have is whether to allow plastic covering in addition to paper. It won’t drastically alter the event like cutting the weight in half would.
