Bill,
<br />
Tem, Emil &amp; I are all using stabs that would be in conformance with a 50% stab rule, if there were such a rule.

<br />
Are the models that you and Tem and Emil currently flying in conformance with this 50% stab rule?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I will be happy to go with whatever the consensus is. The problem is that my current model is designed per the rules that I thought WERE the consensus.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
As far as submitting new sets of rules go I think it would make more sense to work with the ones already submitted instead of having a grocery list of rules to choose from. Don has already submitted a change to eliminate foam from the materials allowed.

<br />Bill ,  You are probably the only one flying with a stab over 15 square inches. From what I remember the rules stated the stab could be no more tan 50% of the projected wing area.  Tom Sova

<br />
<br /><br />Now I have a problem. I emailed Don about the 50% stab and he said he would not remove that rule. The USIC rules and the &quot;national rules&quot; do not have this stab area restriction. My personal A-6 design has a 24 si stab. Changing to a 15 si stab would probably mean designing a new model.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
To confuse matters more I looked at all of the A-6 designs on Jeff Hood's website and found that all of the stabs were under 15 si.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Am I the only A-6 flyer that is not in line with this non-existent rule? If this rule has been used in the past why was it dropped for USIC and the &quot;national rules&quot;?

<br />
A6 flyers,
<br />
<br />The new A6 rule set reportedly submitted to AMA by Don DeLoach contains at least two substantive differences with the &quot;2006 A6 Committee&quot; rules (available in InCo Files section.) The DDL new rules copied here below.
<br />
<br />Notice the prop rule (#8) where the specification &quot;wood&quot; has been deleted. This would allow use of foam for prop blades or whatever else. To back this up, in his rule #10, the general high tech material prohibition and specific foam prohibition has been deleted, compared with 2006 A6 Committee rule set.
<br />
<br />Also notice rule #2--a new thing for A6--where tail area is limited to 50% Some of you would need new stab.
<br />
<br />For all I know, many affected A6 flyers have been contacted by DDL for collaboration, input, feedback about this new rule set. IF SO, please enjoy your new A6. (PS, it takes two rounds of AMA voting, so this won't happen overnight.) 
<br />
JMO,
<br />
Mark F1diddler 
<br />
<br />A6 rules reportedly submitted to AMA for event status:
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;1. Maximum projected wing area: 30 square inches. 
<br />
<br />2. Maximum projected stabilizer area: 15 square inches.
<br />
<br />3. All wing and stab outlines shall be 1/16: square minimum, corners left square/unsanded.
<br />
<br />4. Wing posts 1/16 square (ends may be rounded for inserting into paper tubes).
<br />
<br />5. Motor stick: 6â€ long maximum (measured from the front thrust bearing face
<br />
<br />to the front of the rear hook).
<br />
<br />6. Cambered ribs are acceptable but must be cut from 1/32â€ balsa sheet. Rib depth must be 1/16&quot; minimum.
<br />
<br />7. Weight: 1.2 grams minimum without rubber.
<br />
<br />8. Propeller 6 inch maximum diameter. Blades to be flat 1/32 sheet. (No camber/forming). No thinning of blade thickness and all edges must be left square.
