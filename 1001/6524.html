Gary's is the best idea I've heard yet. Rules changes tend to put designs or planes that are built to older rules on the back burner though there's yet more to be learned from them and much to still be enjoyed. The next step is a variation on SAM and nostalgia driven events. Leaving the older rule classes intact, changing their names to distinguish them from the new FAI or AMA rules is all that's really necessary and the possibilities for competition become deeper and richer.<br><br><br>Jan 31, 2010 06:31:15 PM, Indoor_Construction_at_yahoogroups.com wrote:<br><blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid rgb(102, 153, 204);">

Although in the past I claimed I don't care what happens, I do want to see *something* or other settled with A6. It's probably time to stop supposing we can successfully combine a functional "novice class" together with an event that keeps the experienced indoorist excited about the class also (well, depending on what you call excitement.) So, it's time to favor one side or the other, (not to imply there are only two sides to this.) John Barker (UK) makes the general case that we should keep present flyers happy with whatever they enjoy, period, since there are so few new flyers who ever stick around.<br>
<br>

<br>
Okay, then, I will adopt a position to make A6 an "entry level duration" event, but even closer yet to the stated intentions of Clarence Mather in the original A6 article. Some of the criteria I recall from the orginal A6 article is "easy to build", "fits in small box", "can bump around low ceiling," and "no special indoor materials." I can picture a good model that can not only do all the above, but would also arrest the perception (perception) that a newcomer's A6 will be instantly outclassed by a superior design expertly built by the experienced. For this, let's take a cue from Limited Pennyplane--maximum dimensions specified, with no direction to stretch out, and a generous minimum weight. <br>
<br>
Clarence Mather's orginal A6 model should be the maximum dimensions in everything except prop blade width. His wing was 10" X 3". His tail was 5.25" x 2". His overall length was 9.5" excluding prop. This may seem "not pretty" to the experienced, but to newcomers who have never had a 3 minute flight, it will be beautiful.<br>
<br>
Covering Solution Proposal.<br>
<br>
Materials landscape in USA:<br>
Light "veggie bags" plastic is available almost universally in grocery stores. Some are lighter than others but a common weight is .34g/100 sq". (Cheap-priced grocery stores often use thinner bags.) The lightest similar generic sheet plastic I have found is nominal .25 mil Frost King "drop cloth" material, and it weighed .300g/100 sq", purchased at Menards, (Midwest chain store) $4 for a FF club's lifetime supply. (Can't imagine painters liking to use this plastic because it loves to float.) <br>
<br>
Coincidentally, the lightest reported condenser paper also weighs .300g/100 sq", and only a few indoorist have it. Presumably any other kind of paper is heavier than .300g/100 sq".<br>
<br>
A6 v1.0:<br>
Any covering to be permited that weighs at least .300g/100sq" Flyer should be simply trusted to affirm to CD if asked, "I did not sand or stretch the covering to make it lighter." <br>
<br>
Notice no weighing should be necessary after the newcomer can figure out what a light grade veggie bag feels like, and if you trust my numbers. All concerned, please verify and report. A typical veggie bag of .350g/100sq bag would only weigh .025g more than the lightest (reported) C-paper (over 50 sq" of A6 surfaces.) I believe (?) C-paper requires a lilttle bit more adhesive than this plastic, so that's a wash regarding any significant weight-buying advantage.<br>
<br>
With the specified dimensions and a plastic covering coincidentally matching the lightest unobtainium condensor paper, should be easy to hit 1.2 gram without needing 4 lb wood. But if the Mather A6 cannot be built to 1.2 g with approximately 6 lb wood, and with the above plastic, then the minimum weight should be raised to whatever.<br>
<br>
Feedback, especially from affected newcomers solicited.<br>
