Gary,
<br />
I am not aware of any that differ substantially, only in there relative clarity. I.E. some rules sets are not as clear as others. That was what the Indoor Construction group tried to address. What I learned from participating in that experience was that almost everyone had a pet suggestion/improvement/modification/clarification, including myself. Not unlike what you are suggesting below. It became apparent that trying to incorporate everyone's wishes was impossible or impractical. Eventually, we returned to the original rules (for better or worse) &amp; made changes only where necessary to clear up  ambiguities.
<br />
My new motto is &quot;don't try to fix something that is not broken&quot;
<br />
Please note that there is no rule that states your A6 can not weigh more than 1.2 grams!

Are there any A-6 rules that differ substantially from those we have considered here?

Should Gampi and condenser tissue be considered exotic materials?  They are not high tech, they are traditional, but they are more expensive and harder to find than tissue.  Most domestic tissues weigh in at a little more than a gram per 100 square inches, or 0.45 grams for the proposed 45 square inch rule.  I have found domestic tissues weighing as little as 0.79 grams per 100 square inches, or 0.36 grams for 45.

I see this as a way to get our kids involved in an AMA event.
