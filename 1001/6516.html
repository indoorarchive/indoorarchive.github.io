Sounds like it&#x2019;s time for A-6 Pro. and Limited A-6.  Let the pro class be
<br />
what ever Don&#x2019;s proposal ends up being.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Let the limited class be the rules Mark proposed below with two qualifiers.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Limited is open to anyone who has not won two sanctioned A-6 events, Limited
<br />
or Pro.  Yes that includes if you won two when you were a junior or a
<br />
senior.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Once the Limited Class begins anyone who wins three  sanctioned Limited A-6
<br />
events or posts three or more 6 minute flights is required to move up to
<br />
Pro.

<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br /><br />Although in the past I claimed I don't care what happens, I do want to see
<br />
*something* or other settled with A6. It's probably time to stop supposing
<br />
we can successfully combine a functional &quot;novice class&quot; together with an
<br />
event that keeps the experienced indoorist excited about the class also
<br />
(well, depending on what you call excitement.) So, it's time to favor one
<br />
side or the other, (not to imply there are only two sides to this.) John
<br />
Barker (UK) makes the general case that we should keep present flyers happy
<br />
with whatever they enjoy, period, since there are so few new flyers who ever
<br />
stick around.
<br />
<br />Gary Hodson writes,
<br />
&lt;&lt;To repeat myself, A6 is an entry level indoor duration event. I think
<br />
everyone would agree that was Clarence Mather's intent, as evidenced by the
<br />
restrictions on wood sizes, flat bladed props, covering material, etc.
<br />
Covering with paper is not at all difficult. It may be different from
<br />
covering with plastic but it isn't difficult. &gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Okay, then, I will adopt a position to make A6 an &quot;entry level duration&quot;
<br />
event, but even closer yet to the stated intentions of Clarence Mather in
<br />
the original A6 article. Some of the criteria I recall from the orginal A6
<br />
article is &quot;easy to build&quot;, &quot;fits in small box&quot;, &quot;can bump around low
<br />
ceiling,&quot; and &quot;no special indoor materials.&quot; I can picture a good model that
<br />
can not only do all the above, but would also arrest the perception
<br />
(perception) that a newcomer's A6 will be instantly outclassed by a superior
<br />
design expertly built by the experienced. For this, let's take a cue from
<br />
Limited Pennyplane--maximum dimensions specified, with no direction to
<br />
stretch out, and a generous minimum weight. 
<br />
<br />Clarence Mather's orginal A6 model should be the maximum dimensions in
<br />
everything except prop blade width. His wing was 10&quot; X 3&quot;. His tail was
<br />
5.25&quot; x 2&quot;. His overall length was 9.5&quot; excluding prop. This may seem &quot;not
<br />
pretty&quot; to the experienced, but to newcomers who have never had a 3 minute
<br />
flight, it will be beautiful.
<br />
<br />Covering Solution Proposal.
<br />
<br />Materials landscape in USA:
<br />
Light &quot;veggie bags&quot; plastic is available almost universally in grocery
<br />
stores. Some are lighter than others but a common weight is .34g/100 sq&quot;.
<br />
(Cheap-priced grocery stores often use thinner bags.) The lightest similar
<br />
generic sheet plastic I have found is nominal .25 mil Frost King &quot;drop
<br />
cloth&quot; material, and it weighed .300g/100 sq&quot;, purchased at Menards,
<br />
(Midwest chain store) $4 for a FF club's lifetime supply. (Can't imagine
<br />
painters liking to use this plastic because it loves to float.) 
<br />
<br />Coincidentally, the lightest reported condenser paper also weighs .300g/100
<br />
sq&quot;, and only a few indoorist have it. Presumably any other kind of paper is
<br />
heavier than .300g/100 sq&quot;.
<br />
<br />A6 v1.0:
<br />
Any covering to be permited that weighs at least .300g/100sq&quot; Flyer should
<br />
be simply trusted to affirm to CD if asked, &quot;I did not sand or stretch the
<br />
covering to make it lighter.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Notice no weighing should be necessary after the newcomer can figure out
<br />
what a light grade veggie bag feels like, and if you trust my numbers. All
<br />
concerned, please verify and report. A typical veggie bag of .350g/100sq bag
<br />
would only weigh .025g more than the lightest (reported) C-paper (over 50
<br />
sq&quot; of A6 surfaces.) I believe (?) C-paper requires a lilttle bit more
<br />
adhesive than this plastic, so that's a wash regarding any significant
<br />
weight-buying advantage.
<br />
<br />With the specified dimensions and a plastic covering coincidentally matching
<br />
the lightest unobtainium condensor paper, should be easy to hit 1.2 gram
<br />
without needing 4 lb wood. But if the Mather A6 cannot be built to 1.2 g
<br />
with approximately 6 lb wood, and with the above plastic, then the minimum
<br />
weight should be raised to whatever.
<br />
<br />Feedback, especially from affected newcomers solicited.
