Tem's A6 would conform with a 50% stab rule, if it existed.
<br />
It is not difficult to covr with paper. Is is just different from covering with film. The unintended consequences of allowing flim will transform A6. 
<br />
Quite trying to change someting that is working very well.
<br />
Create your own event &amp; if it is well thought out it too will become popular.

<br />
<br /><br />I’m with you Bill.  I don’t think the 50% stab rule should be in either.  I think it would take Tem’s winning design from 2009 out as well.   I didn’t like it when I saw it but I was making so much noise about how much harder condenser paper was to cover with then the films and how down here it changes tautness so much that I ignored the stab rule.
<br />
One of the clubs mentions in it’s rules that there is now size restriction of the stab.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
To all the experts trying to make it easier for us novices,  condenser paper is harder to apply and it is unstable after it’s on the structure.   You can’t find either film or condenser paper in your local hobby shop.  If you have to order covering, why not make it the one that’s easy to use?

<br />
<br /><br />Now I have a problem. I emailed Don about the 50% stab and he said he would not remove that rule. The USIC rules and the &quot;national rules&quot; do not have this stab area restriction. My personal A-6 design has a 24 si stab. Changing to a 15 si stab would probably mean designing a new model.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />To confuse matters more I looked at all of the A-6 designs on Jeff Hood's website and found that all of the stabs were under 15 si.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Am I the only A-6 flyer that is not in line with this non-existent rule? If this rule has been used in the past why was it dropped for USIC and the &quot;national rules&quot;?

<br />
<br />A6 flyers,
<br />
<br />The new A6 rule set reportedly submitted to AMA by Don DeLoach contains at least two substantive differences with the &quot;2006 A6 Committee&quot; rules (available in InCo Files section.) The DDL new rules copied here below.
<br />
<br />Notice the prop rule (#8) where the specification &quot;wood&quot; has been deleted. This would allow use of foam for prop blades or whatever else. To back this up, in his rule #10, the general high tech material prohibition and specific foam prohibition has been deleted, compared with 2006 A6 Committee rule set.
<br />
<br />Also notice rule #2--a new thing for A6--where tail area is limited to 50% Some of you would need new stab.
<br />
<br />For all I know, many affected A6 flyers have been contacted by DDL for collaboration, input, feedback about this new rule set. IF SO, please enjoy your new A6. (PS, it takes two rounds of AMA voting, so this won't happen overnight.) 
<br />
JMO,
<br />
Mark F1diddler 
<br />
<br />A6 rules reportedly submitted to AMA for event status:
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;1. Maximum projected wing area: 30 square inches. 
<br />
<br />2. Maximum projected stabilizer area: 15 square inches.
<br />
<br />3. All wing and stab outlines shall be 1/16: square minimum, corners left square/unsanded.
<br />
<br />4. Wing posts 1/16 square (ends may be rounded for inserting into paper tubes).
<br />
<br />5. Motor stick: 6â€ long maximum (measured from the front thrust bearing face
<br />
<br />to the front of the rear hook).
<br />
<br />6. Cambered ribs are acceptable but must be cut from 1/32â€ balsa sheet. Rib depth must be 1/16&quot; minimum.
<br />
<br />7. Weight: 1.2 grams minimum without rubber.
<br />
<br />8. Propeller 6 inch maximum diameter. Blades to be flat 1/32 sheet. (No camber/forming). No thinning of blade thickness and all edges must be left square.
<br />
<br />9. Covering: Tissue, condenser paper, or gampi paper - no plastic.
<br />
<br />10. No boron or carbon may be used.&gt;&gt;
