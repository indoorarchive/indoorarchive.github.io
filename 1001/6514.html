Originally in A-6 you had to build the model per the plan, however, the 
<br />
model as designed was not a great flying model when built to the plan, 
<br />
it had torque issues. We still use to get about 3-4 minutes with tissue 
<br />
covered ones that were about 1.5 grams. Once you could use a different 
<br />
design flight times went way up. My dad and I flew scaled down EZBs and 
<br />
we were almost disqualified at the indoor meet in Erie, PA because of that.
<br />
<br />There is no way to ever make a beginner AMA event. It is an idealist 
<br />
goal. All the experienced indoor modelers will fly it as they already 
<br />
do. If  person was a true beginner and built an A-6 it would weigh 
<br />
probably in the 3 grams or more range with hobby shop grade wood and 
<br />
tissue paper. They may be lucky to break 30 seconds with such a model. 
<br />
Then they will see the flight time &quot;experts&quot; get and then say how do 
<br />
they get 10 minutes when they get only 30 seconds. I would think that 
<br />
would be more of a discouragement for a newcomer than paper or plastic. 
<br />
The only way I see to make it a newcomer A-6  event is to make two 
<br />
classes. One class is as it exists now so the regular A-6 people can 
<br />
still participate, then have a limited version which will limit the tail 
<br />
to 50%, have a max length limit, and a high minimum weight that 
<br />
corresponds to what you get with hobbyshop wood. That is how the 3.5 
<br />
grams weight for Jetco ROG was decided. The guy in our club used 
<br />
hobbyshop wood and that is what his weighed.
