Never glue something that needs routine adjustment.... Perhaps tack-
<br />
spot-glue prop blade spars.
<br />
<br />WASH: is adjusting, usually during building, wing spar tip panels 
<br />
away from the flat plane, about 1.5 mm wash-in (up) for most indoor 
<br />
models at the inboard leading edge. Look at the very end of the 
<br />
model's flight. The inboard wing panel leading edge is about a 
<br />
quarter inch higher than the rear spar at the tip. That is wash-in. 
<br />
The high wash could also be due to a failed or loose glue joint at 
<br />
the post-wing spar. Wash looks formed on yours, however. Maybe, the 
<br />
posts are twisted into the sockets - another way to induce wash. I 
<br />
would also suspect that it may have been formed in to compensate for 
<br />
the extra initial power of the motor you use. The two wing spars 
<br />
should be perfectly parallel to have no wash.
<br />
<br />In powered flight you want wash-in on the inboard panel during high 
<br />
torque launch. It increases lift at that panel, prevents the wing 
<br />
from tucking under and the model from augering into the floor. In 
<br />
post-launch flight too much acts like too much incidence and causes 
<br />
stalling. So, level out the wing incidence and wash as much as you 
<br />
can. 
<br />
<br />The earlier suggested changes to rubber winding won't change trim, 
<br />
except to increase duration. Adjustments to the above trim are going 
<br />
to change the flying characteristics. Now you are affecting, 
<br />
improving stability. Basically, you are starting over in the 
<br />
adjustments to improve flight characteristics. And, it's going to be 
<br />
very hard for me to describe/guide via post. I don't understand the 
<br />
process that well. The following link goes to a guide session for 
<br />
basic building and trimming. Check the &quot;No Nonsense Trimming&quot; 
<br />
section. I will cut off this monologue and go back to it myself. The 
<br />
rest is more observation for you to consider when adgusting.
<br />

<br />
<br />For me, it is easier to build to a straight alignment and trim from 
<br />
that point. I never want more than 3 - 5 degrees of decalage, the 
<br />
angle between the wing chord and stab chord. We want some positive 
<br />
angle, incidence, at the wing but not much, 2 degrees or less. It is 
<br />
easier to adjust the angle at the stab. Also, mini-stick is more the 
<br />
hot rod of duration models, so drag becomes more problematic, 
<br />
especially with its small size. You want as little structure exposed 
<br />
to the air as possible.  
<br />
<br />You have a lot of negative stab incidence due to the boom angle. No 
<br />
adjustable stab post? Three degrees negative incidence is usually the 
<br />
most ever wanted. I start with 0-degrees incidence in the stab and 
<br />
almost imediately push the TE up. It's easier to adjust this with a 
<br />
post and socket at the back, but glued wedges work. 
<br />
<br />Also, look at the thrust line of the prop. Down thrust at launch does 
<br />
wonders. I had an A6 drill into ceiling tiles at a 145-foot site in 
<br />
less than a minute. The thrust bearing was loose. Most duration 
<br />
models want some down thrust at launch during high torque climb but 
<br />
little and none during cruise. This is where a flexible (tuned) motor 
<br />
stick comes in handy. 
<br />
<br />Since you have an &quot;extended&quot; thrust bearing (it could be 50% closer 
<br />
to the MS) I would be leary about sanding down the MS a lot. Sorry, 
<br />
saw this after you posted the photos. The TB causes a lot of leverage 
<br />
on your stick. Going to a thinner motor if available is a better 
<br />
idea.  
<br />
<br />Home made thrust bearings can be a real test of patience to learn how 
<br />
to make. Any method that provides the third and fourth hand you need 
<br />
will be a blessing. I speak from an arthritic perspective, however. 
<br />
Your TB and hook need to be as close to the motor stick as possible 
<br />
without snagging rubber, maybe a tenth-inch (2.5 &#x2013; 3 mm); for smaller 
<br />
section motors.
<br />
<br />Time to digest information.
