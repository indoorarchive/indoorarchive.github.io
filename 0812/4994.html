Matthew, there is no need for the nylon bearing at the rear (though it
<br />
won't hurt to have it there) as the rear end is fixed and the torque is
<br />
measured by the twisting of the wire.  Again my only caution is to make
<br />
sure the joints (if any) are mechanically sound.  It won't matter too
<br />
much for the ministick size motors but if you get to winding larger
<br />
material and a joint comes loose it could really smart when the whole
<br />
assembly comes out and slaps your hand.  I observed this happening to one
<br />
of my flying buddies.  
<br />
A caution for your Brisbane site (particularly if you're plane is
<br />
scrubbing the ceiling as we do at most of our sites) - You might think
<br />
that you should wind much more than at your local site but when I first
<br />
went down to the University of Illinois Armory with a 100 foot ceiling I
<br />
was told that I should start by winding the same as for our 40 foot site
<br />
and they were right, the plane got right up to the top right away - then
<br />
later, by winding too much, I managed to leave my newer MiniStick in the
<br />
steel rafters - oh well, it happens.

thanks leroy, I like the simpler one with the metal bracket as the base.
<br />
Could I use a nylon thrust bearing at the back as well as the front of
<br />
the bracket? My brain goes into overload when i read stuff that I do not
<br />
fully understand. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;I have access to lots of music wire (I am a guitar teacher) so most of
<br />
the construction should be easy enough. I just do not have a soldering
<br />
iron.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Can I just say that all your help so far has been fantastic. Furthermore,
<br />
If i can acheive 5 minutes flying with my ministick I will win this years
<br />
ministick comp, hands down. As far as I know none of the guys get 5
<br />
minutes flying time. If I could get 5 minutes in the hall accross the
<br />
road (which is tiny) The gym that we fly in at brisbane is 3 times as
<br />
high and I should be able to do over and above 5 minutes!!! that would be
<br />
so satisfying. I will do some testing today. stay tuned.

Matthew there are plans around but here's a copy of a simple one and one
<br />
more complex.  I like the more complex one (by Cezar Banks) but the
<br />
specified wire is too heavy for ministick (I need to make another with a
<br />
thinner torque wire).  Make sure that any wire joints don't rely on just
<br />
solder but use a positive connection.

there's a cheetah in the tank?? what does that mean? I never even
<br />
considered winding to 90% capacity and then backing off to the torque
<br />
required for a no touch ceiling run.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
should i glue the front wing post to the fuse and leave the rear post for
<br />
trim adjustments?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
When you say WASH what does that mean? How do I get rid of it?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
and .027 rubber that is .68mm YIKES!! I have some .8mm that I might try
<br />
first to see what happens. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
How do i get a torque meter? Can I make one?

<br />I don't see images, but the Utube video was enlightening. Prop looked 
<br />
good, and your comments mean there's a cheetah in the tank. 
<br />
<br />Definitely wound to &quot;no touch&quot; torque. You want a torque meter, to 
<br />
record the no-touch force; then wind to 90% turns and back off to 
<br />
the &quot;no touch&quot; power. It will extend the flight time, giving you more 
<br />
turns, longer cruise torque.  
<br />
<br />.039&quot; (1mm) is going to be too powerful for the weight adjusted 
<br />
model. It's a good size for A6, however.
<br />
<br />Others on the list might see more than me. My thoughts: 
<br />
<br />The wash can be reduced. I don't use any, relying on the MS to twist 
<br />
it in during launch torque and climb. Fixed wash equals cruise 
<br />
hassles and drag. This is a good opportunity to shave down the mass 
<br />
of the motor stick. Remove smidges of incidence - the bobbing can be 
<br />
that, or the high wash angles. 
<br />
<br />MS should be about .08 - .10 grams. Mine are .07(-) and hard wood, 
<br />
7# - 8#. Thinner sections twist better. Put about 5-7 degrees tilt in 
<br />
the stab - drop right side. Straighten the wing spars - no wash. Get 
<br />
some .023&quot;-.027&quot; rubber, same 11&quot; length and wind it to 90% of break 
<br />
turns to test full model duration (and endurance). .027&quot; is 
<br />
competition size for your lower ceiling. Start grinding down the MS. 
<br />
When the weight gets down close and the wound rubber doesn't break 
<br />
the stick, but the stab levels out with the wing spar line, you are 
<br />
close. The MS will automatically twist wash-in into the left wing 
<br />
panel. It's ready for fine tuning in the field house. 
<br />
<br />If you can beat on the ceiling, test at full torque. A half, or third 
<br />
motor might help at this stage. The idea is to file down more wood 
<br />
section on the sides near the front wing post and increase the launch 
<br />
wash slightly. I've never done anything with the stick behind the 
<br />
posts but to reduce weight. MHO, the short moments counteract any 
<br />
advantage to moving the thrust line, like in EZB. Mini-stick seems to 
<br />
like steady, straight booms.
<br />
<br />This is fun homework.
