thanks for the advice leroy. sorry to hear about your ministick getting stuck in the rafters. I live in Brisbane which is about 2 1/2 hours away from toowoomba.
<br />
<br />regards

Matthew, there is no need for the nylon bearing at the rear (though it won't hurt to have it there) as the rear end is fixed and the torque is measured by the twisting of the wire.  Again my only caution is to make sure the joints (if any) are mechanically sound.  It won't matter too much for the ministick size motors but if you get to winding larger material and a joint comes loose it could really smart when the whole assembly comes out and slaps your hand.  I observed this happening to one of my flying buddies.  
<br />
A caution for your Brisbane site (particularly if you're plane is scrubbing the ceiling as we do at most of our sites) - You might think that you should wind much more than at your local site but when I first went down to the University of Illinois Armory with a 100 foot ceiling I was told that I should start by winding the same as for our 40 foot site and they were right, the plane got right up to the top right away - then later, by winding too much, I managed to leave my newer MiniStick in the steel rafters - oh well, it happens.
<br />
<br />Where are you located in Australia ?  I've got a Sister-in-Law in Toowoomba.

thanks leroy, I like the simpler one with the metal bracket as the base. Could I use a nylon thrust bearing at the back as well as the front of the bracket? My brain goes into overload when i read stuff that I do not fully understand. 
<br />
<br /> I have access to lots of music wire (I am a guitar teacher) so most of the construction should be easy enough. I just do not have a soldering iron.
<br />
<br />Can I just say that all your help so far has been fantastic. Furthermore, If i can acheive 5 minutes flying with my ministick I will win this years ministick comp, hands down. As far as I know none of the guys get 5 minutes flying time. If I could get 5 minutes in the hall accross the road (which is tiny) The gym that we fly in at brisbane is 3 times as high and I should be able to do over and above 5 minutes!!! that would be so satisfying. I will do some testing today. stay tuned.

Matthew there are plans around but here's a copy of a simple one and one more complex.  I like the more complex one (by Cezar Banks) but the specified wire is too heavy for ministick (I need to make another with a thinner torque wire).  Make sure that any wire joints don't rely on just solder but use a positive connection.

there's a cheetah in the tank?? what does that mean? I never even considered winding to 90% capacity and then backing off to the torque required for a no touch ceiling run.
<br />
<br />should i glue the front wing post to the fuse and leave the rear post for trim adjustments?
<br />
<br />When you say WASH what does that mean? How do I get rid of it?
<br />
<br />and .027 rubber that is .68mm YIKES!! I have some .8mm that I might try first to see what happens. 
<br />
<br />How do i get a torque meter? Can I make one?

<br />I don't see images, but the Utube video was enlightening. Prop looked 
<br />
good, and your comments mean there's a cheetah in the tank. 
<br />
<br />Definitely wound to &quot;no touch&quot; torque. You want a torque meter, to 
<br />
record the no-touch force; then wind to 90% turns and back off to 
<br />
the &quot;no touch&quot; power. It will extend the flight time, giving you more 
<br />
turns, longer cruise torque.  
<br />
<br />.039&quot; (1mm) is going to be too powerful for the weight adjusted 
<br />
model. It's a good size for A6, however.
<br />
<br />Others on the list might see more than me. My thoughts: 
<br />
<br />The wash can be reduced. I don't use any, relying on the MS to twist 
<br />
it in during launch torque and climb. Fixed wash equals cruise 
<br />
hassles and drag. This is a good opportunity to shave down the mass 
<br />
of the motor stick. Remove smidges of incidence - the bobbing can be 
<br />
that, or the high wash angles. 
<br />
<br />MS should be about .08 - .10 grams. Mine are .07(-) and hard wood, 
<br />
7# - 8#. Thinner sections twist better. Put about 5-7 degrees tilt in 
<br />
the stab - drop right side. Straighten the wing spars - no wash. Get 
<br />
some .023&quot;-.027&quot; rubber, same 11&quot; length and wind it to 90% of break 
<br />
turns to test full model duration (and endurance). .027&quot; is 
<br />
competition size for your lower ceiling. Start grinding down the MS. 
<br />
When the weight gets down close and the wound rubber doesn't break 
<br />
the stick, but the stab levels out with the wing spar line, you are 
<br />
close. The MS will automatically twist wash-in into the left wing 
<br />
panel. It's ready for fine tuning in the field house. 
<br />
<br />If you can beat on the ceiling, test at full torque. A half, or third 
<br />
motor might help at this stage. The idea is to file down more wood 
<br />
section on the sides near the front wing post and increase the launch 
<br />
wash slightly. I've never done anything with the stick behind the 
<br />
posts but to reduce weight. MHO, the short moments counteract any 
<br />
advantage to moving the thrust line, like in EZB. Mini-stick seems to 
<br />
like steady, straight booms.
<br />
<br />This is fun homework.
