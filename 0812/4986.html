Cheetah in the tank... Tiger in the tank.. (An old Gasoline advert.) 
<br />
Simply means you have a smooth running prop shaft, and other things 
<br />
are holding back performance.
<br />
<br />At existing weight and rubber section you can probably double the 
<br />
flight time, or more.
<br />
<br />Backing off turns is the standard for getting the optimum power curve 
<br />
(stored energy) from the rubber. Rubber power follows a geometric 
<br />
curve, similar to the edge line of a quartered ellipse. The vertical 
<br />
axis for the curve is energy; the horizontal is turns. It's very 
<br />
steep in the last 50 to 150 turns (generally un-useable energy), then 
<br />
leveling out to what I call cruise torque, where the model is losing 
<br />
elevation but so slowly you barely notice. It's a gradual power slope 
<br />
down to a point where the prop turns but has no lifting power, the 
<br />
model is generating lift by gliding only at the end. 
<br />
<br />Let's say optimum turns:torque (turns:energy) for your present motor 
<br />
is a figurative 2100:10. It is far too much stored energy for safe 
<br />
launch and flight. It has a power curve. Right now you wind in 600 to 
<br />
1000 turns at a figurative torque of 4 for launch (1000:4) to make 
<br />
flight managable. There is a different power curve for the energy you 
<br />
put into the rubber. 
<br />
<br />To graphically demonstrate, draw two ellipses (well, quarter 
<br />
ellipses). Make one 10 units long and 4 units high. Make the other 21 
<br />
units long and 10 units high. Now, overlay the longer curve with the 
<br />
baselines aligned. Slide the long curve over the short curve until 
<br />
its curve intersects the short one at 4 units high. The space, area, 
<br />
between the two lines is the extra energy and turns your motor has at 
<br />
the same launch torque. Backing off turns is the equivalent of 
<br />
sliding the higher energy curve to match the energy of your present 
<br />
no-touch winding practice. Keep in mind, the space in the overlying 
<br />
curve beyond the intersection is wasted energy.
<br />
<br />By winding to maximum turns-torque and backing off energy, you are 
<br />
optimizing the energy of the current rubber motor for the model. 
<br />
Because your rubber section has more energy potential than the model 
<br />
can handle at maximum turns:torque, the potential energy is lost - 
<br />
you are carrying excess baggage in rubber. Therefor, you reduce cross-
<br />
section (and weight) to maximise the the rubber-weight-energy 
<br />
capacity of the model. Excess weight hurts duration. 
<br />
<br />I mentioned A6 and that your current .039&quot; (1 mm) was a good size for 
<br />
it. A6 is has a 30 square inch wing, 120 grams and a flat 6&quot; diameter 
<br />
prop. With a 14&quot; &#x2013; 15&quot; length of your rubber A6 will excede 5 minutes 
<br />
in the same site, no-touch. The rubber section is optimized for the 
<br />
bigger model and demonstrates how much excess power you are using.
<br />
<br />I always say too much. Let's spare my arthritis, and save the rest of 
<br />
the questions for later. Play with the rubber, weight, and torque 
<br />
curve for a while. You will enjoy the results.
