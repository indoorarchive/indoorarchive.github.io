thanks leroy, I like the simpler one with the metal bracket as the base. Could I use a nylon thrust bearing at the back as well as the front of the bracket? My brain goes into overload when i read stuff that I do not fully understand. 
<br />
<br /> I have access to lots of music wire (I am a guitar teacher) so most of the construction should be easy enough. I just do not have a soldering iron.
<br />
<br />Can I just say that all your help so far has been fantastic. Furthermore, If i can acheive 5 minutes flying with my ministick I will win this years ministick comp, hands down. As far as I know none of the guys get 5 minutes flying time. If I could get 5 minutes in the hall accross the road (which is tiny) The gym that we fly in at brisbane is 3 times as high and I should be able to do over and above 5 minutes!!! that would be so satisfying. I will do some testing today. stay tuned.
<br />
<br />regards
<br />
Matthew

Matthew there are plans around but here's a copy of a simple one and one more complex.  I like the more complex one (by Cezar Banks) but the specified wire is too heavy for ministick (I need to make another with a thinner torque wire).  Make sure that any wire joints don't rely on just solder but use a positive connection.

there's a cheetah in the tank?? what does that mean? I never even considered winding to 90% capacity and then backing off to the torque required for a no touch ceiling run.
<br />
<br />should i glue the front wing post to the fuse and leave the rear post for trim adjustments?
<br />
<br />When you say WASH what does that mean? How do I get rid of it?
<br />
<br />and .027 rubber that is .68mm YIKES!! I have some .8mm that I might try first to see what happens. 
<br />
<br />How do i get a torque meter? Can I make one?

<br />I don't see images, but the Utube video was enlightening. Prop looked 
<br />
good, and your comments mean there's a cheetah in the tank. 
<br />
<br />Definitely wound to &quot;no touch&quot; torque. You want a torque meter, to 
<br />
record the no-touch force; then wind to 90% turns and back off to 
<br />
the &quot;no touch&quot; power. It will extend the flight time, giving you more 
<br />
turns, longer cruise torque.  
<br />
<br />.039&quot; (1mm) is going to be too powerful for the weight adjusted 
<br />
model. It's a good size for A6, however.
<br />
<br />Others on the list might see more than me. My thoughts: 
<br />
<br />The wash can be reduced. I don't use any, relying on the MS to twist 
<br />
it in during launch torque and climb. Fixed wash equals cruise 
<br />
hassles and drag. This is a good opportunity to shave down the mass 
<br />
of the motor stick. Remove smidges of incidence - the bobbing can be 
<br />
that, or the high wash angles. 
<br />
<br />MS should be about .08 - .10 grams. Mine are .07(-) and hard wood, 
<br />
7# - 8#. Thinner sections twist better. Put about 5-7 degrees tilt in 
<br />
the stab - drop right side. Straighten the wing spars - no wash. Get 
<br />
some .023&quot;-.027&quot; rubber, same 11&quot; length and wind it to 90% of break 
<br />
turns to test full model duration (and endurance). .027&quot; is 
<br />
competition size for your lower ceiling. Start grinding down the MS. 
<br />
When the weight gets down close and the wound rubber doesn't break 
<br />
the stick, but the stab levels out with the wing spar line, you are 
<br />
close. The MS will automatically twist wash-in into the left wing 
<br />
panel. It's ready for fine tuning in the field house. 
<br />
<br />If you can beat on the ceiling, test at full torque. A half, or third 
<br />
motor might help at this stage. The idea is to file down more wood 
<br />
section on the sides near the front wing post and increase the launch 
<br />
wash slightly. I've never done anything with the stick behind the 
<br />
posts but to reduce weight. MHO, the short moments counteract any 
<br />
advantage to moving the thrust line, like in EZB. Mini-stick seems to 
<br />
like steady, straight booms.
<br />
<br />This is fun homework.
