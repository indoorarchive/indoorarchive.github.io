thanks bruce for the info. 
<br />
<br />My props have helical twist.
<br />
<br />rubber is 11&quot; loop of 1mm square and weighs .5grams
<br />
<br />The model weighs .6grams without rubber so all up weight with existing motor is 1.1grams. A little heavy but it is my first ministick. i may be able to take some weight off with some light sanding of the fuselage.
<br />
<br />ceiling is normal pointed variety and is about 20 feet high. here is video you will see the obstructions that I mean.
<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wzy7v0funk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wzy7v0funk</a>
<br />
<br />I have calipers and a home made balance beam made for me by my engineer freind craig. 
<br />
<br />I do not have a torque meter
<br />
<br />I just sat down with the model and put it in it's cradle and just watched it. The blades do move a little but i noticed that one of the blades always pointed to the floor more than the other.... OOPS. Sanded that one back and the prop is balanced. When you say the prop has to turn when it is in it's cradle do you mean that it moves around or spins like a prop should? Mine just moves around in my room with all the windows closed. It does not turn completely around. I will post some pics of the model on the Yahoo forum so that you can see first hand what it is like.
<br />
<br />thanks for the help fella's
<br />
<br />regards
<br />
Matthew

<br />
<br />Unfortunately, we always need to know everything. Ceiling with no 
<br />
obstructions; weight of model, rubber section, length, rubber weight, 
<br />
turns, torque, number of turns left after landing, height, weight, 
<br />
social security number, bank account number, etc.; put a &quot;?&quot; 
<br />
preceding every comma. The usual stuff.... 
<br />
<br />Then, we (you) start dialing in the outrageously giddy flight times, 
<br />
ie., the fun stuff - for everyone.
<br />
<br />Ministicks do very well in any height room when there are no ceiling 
<br />
obstructions or things to snag the model. They were called parlor 
<br />
sticks, for flying in kitchens and living rooms.
<br />
<br />My guess is you may not have super fancy weighing scales - for indoor 
<br />
duration, something reading 0.01g is good. Or, a torque meter; or 
<br />
calipers. There are wire spring scales (designs on web), balance 
<br />
beams (again, designs on web, you have a new dollar bill, .98 grams); 
<br />
and torque meter designs (with thought and wire one could be made 
<br />
from a ball-point pen.) And, finally, stick calipers can be gotten at 
<br />
many hardware stores for really cheap. Indoor modeling is for poor 
<br />
people - which most of us are, now.
<br />
<br />Aach, just checked. Files don't have much. 
<br />
<br />Is your prop flat, or have hellical twist? If built on a standard 
<br />
form, the 50% of radius mark is a 45-degree angle. Get both blades to 
<br />
the same angle.
<br />
<br />Here's some targets for a model at its design weight, .43 grams. 11-
<br />
inch, .023-inch x .042&quot; section, about .4 grams of Tan II rubber. A 
<br />
perfect flight will have very little launch heebie-jeebies and look 
<br />
like a butterfly poking around in the ceiling for 10 to 11 minutes. 
<br />
The rest of the flight &quot;separates the men from the boys&quot; as Andrew 
<br />
Tagliafico likes to say. 
<br />
<br />Before you do any flying, make sure the prop shaft spins without any 
<br />
friction. If the model sits in the stooge and the prop just sits 
<br />
there too, there is friction. The little bugger has to be a pain in 
<br />
the !_at_!#~ and want to turn. Even when you can't feel a zephar. This 
<br />
is the key to long flights. Don't fly until the prop turns by itself.
<br />
<br />Grab a sheet of paper. Write down everything from the above list of 
<br />
critical questions. Send the personal data to me. =) Before you wind 
<br />
and fly, take a section of the rubber you will use - about 2&quot;, 3&quot; 
<br />
loop and wind it to break. Count the turns. Try it again; average the 
<br />
break count and call it 100% breaking turns. Wind the real motor to 
<br />
90% of the breaking turns - per inch! 
<br />
<br />Come back to the farm with the data and 90% of the guys wanting 
<br />
competition will reveal more secrets.
