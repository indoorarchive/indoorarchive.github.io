Since the USIC / AMA Indoor FF Nationals attendance was down this 
<br />
year, we decided to be proactive and hold a raffle to generate a 
<br />
donation that would supplement the entry fee income.
<br />
<br />See below for the letter that accompanied the donation to the AMA.
<br />
<br />Also, a huge &quot;thank you&quot; to A2Z corp., who donated a huge box full of 
<br />
merchandise for the raffle and for prizes.  In addition to the Jones-
<br />
style balsa stripper and machined blade holder for Harlan-style balsa 
<br />
strippers I had seen before, there was a new Harlan-style balsa 
<br />
stripper kit that looked pretty sweet.  There were also many orange 
<br />
boxes of laser-cut Peck Polymers kits, a set of IMS kits (including 
<br />
the &quot;three ministicks&quot; kit that I built when I just started Indoor), 
<br />
and a nice selection of Tru-Weight balsa.  It seems that Tom Sova and 
<br />
Jeff Hood made off with a majority of the loot (they'd better play 
<br />
Power Ball with the kind of luck they were having!)

<br />
<br />Dear Mr. Cherry:
<br />
<br />We just finished another amazing US Indoor Championship / AMA Indoor 
<br />
Free Flight Nationals &#x2013; a week of top notch model airplane 
<br />
competition, promotion of Indoor Free Flight, and renewal of 
<br />
friendships that has become an important part of many people's lives.
<br />
<br />The entire Indoor Free Flight community wishes to thank the AMA for 
<br />
their continued support of this important event.  We understand and 
<br />
appreciate the financial and human resources that are committed each 
<br />
year to running a contest of this size and caliber.  
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, our participation was down compared to recent years, 
<br />
with many people citing economic issues as the reason for their 
<br />
absence.  They all expressed a desire to participate in the future, 
<br />
though, so we fully expect attendance to rebound.
<br />
<br />Those who were able to attend wanted to proactively communicate to 
<br />
the powers-that-be how much we need this event to continue and 
<br />
demonstrate the Indoor Free Flight community's commitment to the 
<br />
USIC / AMA Indoor FF Nationals, so we held a raffle to raise funds 
<br />
for a donation to supplement its other income.
<br />
<br />Enclosed, please find the $487 we collected, which will hopefully 
<br />
offset some of the entry fee shortfall, as well as convey the 
<br />
significance the contest holds for us.  USIC / AMA Indoor FF 
<br />
Nationals is more than competition; it is a key component for 
<br />
promoting and maintaining participation levels in the discipline of 
<br />
Indoor Free Flight.
<br />
<br />We, the co-Event Directors, and many others in the Indoor Free Flight 
<br />
community, stand ready to offer any support or assistance that you 
<br />
may find helpful with respect to the planning and support of this 
<br />
event.  We hope that if any issue comes up regarding attendance or 
<br />
costs of the USIC / AMA Indoor FF Nationals, you and the rest of the 
<br />
Executive Council will choose to ensure its future.  
<br />
<br /><br />Sincerely,
<br />
John Kagan, Tony Pavel, and Rob Romash

2008 Indoor Free Flight Nationals co-Event Directors
