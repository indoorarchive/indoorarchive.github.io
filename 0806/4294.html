Thanks for the enquiry and further advice on the props.  I will first
<br />
explain what they are for.  Our Indoor Tech Committee is trying to attract
<br />
more modellers to indoor flying and to this end have set up a Challenge to
<br />
improve a beginner&#x2019;s model, called the &#x2018;Gyminnie Cricket&#x2019;, and to have a
<br />
competition for the improved models towards the end of the year.  The basic
<br />
GC is a heavily built indoor model of 15&#x201d; span with a motor stick and a tail
<br />
boom and one of those horrible plastic prop assemblies as used on &#x2018;Sleek
<br />
Streaks&#x2019;.  The wing area is the same as an EZB but the tailplane area is
<br />
only 25%.  The improved GCs must retain the same wing and tail outlines and
<br />
the same motor stick and boom length but can be lightened and can use any
<br />
propeller.  The tricky bit is the small tailplane.  If you make a very light
<br />
propeller you may have to carry ballast in the nose because moving the wing
<br />
backwards too far creates stability problems.
<br />
<br />I started with the 10&#x201d; diameter prop on the right of the photo.  I needed
<br />
about 0.5 g to keep the correct cg position so I only thinned the blade wood
<br />
to about 0.027 and moulded it with the grain in line with the spar.
<br />
Although the face of the forme (as on the LH side of the photo) was flat the
<br />
blade still finished with about 8.5% camber at the widest part of the blade.
<br />
Too much in my opinion.  In use the prop seems to work fine in the limited
<br />
hall time that I have had.
<br />
<br />I decided to try a larger, 12&#x201d; dia, propeller, and that was when I posted
<br />
the original query. The blades were  sanded a little thinner, because of the
<br />
increased area, and both propellers finished at 0.49g.  This time the grain
<br />
was skewed and the blades gained no camber!  I hoped for and expected some.
<br />
Also, as the blades are still quite thick, I only carried the spar part way
<br />
up the blade; this was probably a mistake because the blades are now gaining
<br />
some elliptical dihedral at the tips!
<br />
<br />I think the propellers will work quite well &#x2013; after all I built an A6
<br />
recently and they fly very well even though the propellers appear to be an
<br />
abomination.  However I am not happy because I don&#x2019;t feel in control.  The
<br />
blade angles come off the forme as intended but the camber seems to be a
<br />
lottery.
<br />
