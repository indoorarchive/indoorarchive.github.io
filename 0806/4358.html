<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; I believe this minimum weight rule was

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; field&quot; a bit and not allow the event to become into a quasi-penny

&nbsp;&nbsp;plane 
<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;most 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; modelers could meet while at the same time preserving a good degree 
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; endurance capability. It seems to have achieved these goals.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;What would be your evidence for such a claim?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the obvious reality is that weight rule did nothing to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;preclude the use of lightweight indoor building technique. Instead, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;it simply reduced the viable subjects down to a single plane (unless 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;you choose to fly more for more fun than for competition which, of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;course, is perfectly fine).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The current models are at least as challenging as a Pennyplane, so 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the rule didn't achieve that goal either. Leaving the community with 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a few options:
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi Guys 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have flown no-cals for years  I thought I'd chime in :-) We used to have 2 catagorys of no -Cal ,unlimited and 6.2 grams. Funny thing is that back then with 2 gram no cals we were geing 8 - 9 minutes  and now we're getting over 8 now a days  with the heavy ones . I don't doubt someone will bust 9 mins someday.( Hope it's me :-)) 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately certain designs lend themselves to be better for the heavy class ,Fury ,Cassutt because of the heavy weight a big area wing is better .However a bigger modl e when lightened up too much gets flimsy and has higher drag .The Cessna Cardinal or the BD were 2 of the better light weight models.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My Cassutt was the first of the low aspect ratio models that performed well however as the times went up  the  effect of drag from the landing gear became more apparent hence my change to the Fury . As in most scale events certain models will prevail due to good moment arms ,tail volumes,nose length. Example, if peanut scale was strictly duration most guys would fly Fikes. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence the myriad of scale events designed to stop the one model from  dominating an event. Hence we have a score based not only on time but BONUS points. Kinda like a super delegate . But guess what happened ? The VOISON!! Bonus points galore!! :-)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So what's the answer? I don't know ,all I know is I like No Cal as it is and if there was an unlimited No Cal event I'd build one  for that class too . I just would like to see the rules consistant contest to contest. Nothng worse then going to 3 contests with 3 different sets of No cal weights that's my only complaint :-)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;There , I succumbed to the urge  to pipe up LOL!!!
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;See Ya 
<br />
