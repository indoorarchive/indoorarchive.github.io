3:27 is an excellent time if, as I understand it, the flyable height 
<br />
was 23 feet at the 2008 SciOly Wright Stuff nationals. That's close 
<br />
to the maximum time in that height for a plane that meets the 2008 
<br />
Wright Stuff rules, in my opinion. 
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear that the conditions were so challenging.  But good 
<br />
flyers need to be able to adjust. 
<br />
<br />At our regionals, we have about 30 Wright Stuff teams each year in 
<br />
Division C (high school). The competition takes place in a 
<br />
challenging pyramid shaped gym with a suspended central score board 
<br />
and dangling lights outboard of the scoreboard all around. It is 
<br />
often a real problem getting all the official flights in before the 
<br />
event ends at 12:20 p.m. Students have many other events and they 
<br />
sometimes get bunched up when they go to the Wright Stuff event, 
<br />
which is a walk-in event (no appointments or scheduled competitor 
<br />
times). 
<br />
<br />Our Wright Stuff team is never allowed to practice in that gym ahead 
<br />
of time, under threat of disqualification. The high school where our 
<br />
regionals are held does not want to be bothered with students showing 
<br />
up from other schools on days other than the SciOly official regional 
<br />
competition day. 
<br />
<br />On the day of our regional competition practice flights are allowed 
<br />
up until 8:00 a.m. At that time it is realtively cold (e.g. 60 
<br />
degrees F.), the doors are open and people are running around, 
<br />
especially balloon launched glider (BLG)competitors (middle school 
<br />
kids). Our EC event captain is excellent. A former Wright Stuff state 
<br />
gold medalist herself, she is fair, really knows the rules, and runs 
<br />
a tight, organized competition. She makes a determination that all 
<br />
flyers will not get their two official flights in if there are 
<br />
practice flights after 8:00 a.m, whether they be trim flights or full 
<br />
flights. Therefore no flights, except official flights, are allowed 
<br />
after 8:00 a.m. at our regionals. But everyone knows this in advance. 
<br />
So it is an equal playing field, except, perhaps, for the Wright 
<br />
Stuff team that goes to that high school. But that high school team 
<br />
is not very good in Wright Stuff anyway. 
<br />
<br />So our Wright Stuff team never risked practice flights before 8:00 
<br />
a.m. under those dangerous conditions. They wouldn't tell you much 
<br />
anyway, as your plane should already be well trimmed. Instead, they 
<br />
adopted a different strategy. The first offical flight was a very 
<br />
conservative flight, sometimes no higher than half the ceiling height 
<br />
to gauge the rate of climb under the present ambient conditions, 
<br />
usually close to 80 degrees F. by that time, and with upwards 
<br />
convection due to many spectators, and sometimes drift. 
<br />
<br />Then, using data from flight logs, and scaling the results, the 
<br />
rubber motor is wound to the correct torque for a second official no-
<br />
touch flight close to the ceilng.
<br />
<br />Our Wright Stuff teams' desire has always been to do one test flight 
<br />
with a partial motor just before our official flights, to gauge the 
<br />
rate of climb and the max height reached by the plane, but they have 
<br />
never been afforded that luxury at regionals or at the state finals. 
<br />
<br />Weather can affect the rubber motors and cause them to break when 
<br />
they otherwise wouldn't. If you observe lots of rubber motor breakage 
<br />
during winding by other competitors, wind more conservatively. Either 
<br />
that, or bring plenty of extra rubber motors (lubed afte weigh-in) 
<br />
and be prepared to retrieve them and wind quickly before your 8 
<br />
minutes have expired. Sometimes rubber motor breakage can be 
<br />
attributed to inadequate lubrication of the rubber motor. 
<br />
<br />Our old time mentors have often told our WS team that if they are not 
<br />
breaking their rubber motors, they are not winding enough. 
<br />
<br />Our team built their own planes for Science Olympiad Wright Stuff 
<br />
competition using their own designs but borrowing concepts from 
<br />
mentors Cezar Banks and John Hutchison.  They did not build the 
<br />
Freedom Flight or Ray Harlan kits, although good results can be 
<br />
achieved with those kits.  Our team beat all the kit planes in our 
<br />
2008 regionals and state finals. I will post a picture in this Group 
<br />
of one of their planes.
