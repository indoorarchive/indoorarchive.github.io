While a lower minimum weight sounds good on the surface, I believe it would
<br />
only make matters worse. People would just build 3-gram Hosler Furies!
<br />
<br />The problem with No-cal is the 16&quot; wingspan limit. The experts found that
<br />
giant-chord wings flew the longest--and the largest-chord design in aviation
<br />
history is the Hosler Fury, so it became dominant quickly. Since then No-cal
<br />
interest at USIC has declined steadily. No diversity of subjects equals a
<br />
stale, dying event. 
<br />
<br />A simple solution to the Hosler dilemma is to institute a maximum wing area
<br />
in addition to the 16&quot; wing span limit. That way a 16&quot; span Hosler would not
<br />
be legal but perhaps a scaled-down 12&quot; span one would. Then you would have
<br />
other designs with wingspans closer to 16&quot; (but the same wing area) flying
<br />
against the 12&quot; span Hoslers. Of course a reasonable minimum weight would
<br />
still be in effect for all models so all would be flying at the same wing
<br />
loading.
<br />
<br />What is the wing area of a 16&quot; Hosler? Looks like about 16&quot; x 8.75&quot; chord,
<br />
according to the three view I have. This is around 140 sq. inches (sheesh!).
<br />
A 12&quot; Hosler would be around 78 sq. inches. For comparison I just did some
<br />
rough caluculations:
<br />
<br />a 16&quot; Cassutt is about 93 sq inches, a Boo-Ray is 75 sq. in., and P-51D is
<br />
47 sq. inches.
<br />
<br />What do you guys think?
<br />

<br />Other than a lower weight limit, what would a &quot;wing loading rule&quot; look
<br />
like...???  I would -not- think that something more complicated than a
<br />
minimum weight would be good for the event...  (maybe I'm missing
<br />
something here that I should know...)  
<br />
<br />And since we wouldn't be changing the FAC rules for No-Cal, just the
<br />
USIC rules, why would we have to get them involved...?  
<br />
<br />I actually think that everything is fine as is, other than the 6.2g...
<br />
&nbsp;And it seems that others also think that 3g (nice round number...)
<br />
would work...  (Personally, I would allow condenser paper covering,
<br />
but I can live with tissue...)
<br />
<br />Does anyone know -for sure- what the procedure is for proposing and
<br />
passing a USIC rule change is...?  These are non-AMA events, so they
<br />
don't fall under that procedure, but there must be something...
