I have never liked the 6.2 g. minimum weight limit. It  seems like an 
<br />
unusually high minimum weight limit, especially for an  indoor NoCal. It results in a 
<br />
relatively heavy model that is only flown at  the USIC (&amp; a very few other 
<br />
club events). It is not a practical model to  fly in our typical low ceiling 
<br />
gyms. And the resulted is that the Hosler is  the only competitive design which, 
<br />
for me, takes a lot of the fun out of the  event. I think part of the 
<br />
challenge should be in selecting a  design that balances wing area &amp; lightness. I 
<br />
would favor using  the FAC rules including the three flight total or as a second 
<br />
choice a lighter  weight limit such as 3 grams. With no weight limit (but FAC 
<br />
restrictions on  construction materials) It would be interesting to see which 
<br />
designs prove to be  successful. I.E. a very light model with modest dimensions 
<br />
or a   heavier model with larger cord, length etc. I think it would be a long 
<br />
time  before one design dominated. 
<br />
One final thought, The USIC seems to have no mechanism for proposing rules  
<br />
changes.

I think that you nailed it on the head... :)
<br />
<br />Although, I would fall  in the first category, as I built a Fike two
<br />
years ago, and had a huge blob  of clay on it to get it to 6.2g... and
<br />
did almost 6 min (almost got to  third past a Hosler...) but it was
<br />
pretty much maxed out... if I could have  gotten rid of the extra
<br />
weight, I think that it could have done 6 1/2 or  better (it was built
<br />
like a tank...) It would have been pretty simple to  get it to 4g...
<br />
<br />John is right that building and trimming a Hosler is  -at least- as
<br />
hard as building a Pennyplane..hard as building a Pennyplane..&lt;WBR&gt;. pr
<br />
WWII No-Cal to 6.2g isn't very hard, but you aren't going to be  very
<br />
competitive with it... Which I really never understood the &quot;logic&quot;  of
<br />
putting weight restrictions on classes like this anyway, since if  you
<br />
can't build a typical No-Cal to 4g or so, then you -aren't- going  to
<br />
be building a competitive Hosler anyway... so then just build  what
<br />
you want and fly for fun... nothing wrong with that at all...
<br />
<br />I  like No-Cals, as they go together fairly quick, and are fun... but
<br />
I'm not  going to build another Hosler just to have a chance to place
<br />
in an  event...
<br />
<br />I would suggest the following:
<br />
<br />- 3g minimum weight
<br />
-  Tissue or condenser paper covering, no film
<br />
- The other rules would stay  the same...
<br />
<br />I also think that it is ironic that all of the FAC No-Cal  rules that I
<br />
could find had no weight limit, only on the USIC rules... go  figure...
