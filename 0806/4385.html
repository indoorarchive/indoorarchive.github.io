<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; While a lower minimum weight sounds good on the surface, I believe it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; only make matters worse. People would just build 3-gram Hosler Furies!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree
</em><br />
<br />I agree on that also, although having built a Hosler, I for one would
<br />
be impressed enough to not complain about someone who built a 3g
<br />
Hosler that stayed together...  I'm sure it is possible, but it
<br />
wouldn't be easy...  
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess the first question is do we really need a rule change in  No
</em><br />
-Cal ? 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From what I understand entrys were way down this year in all events.
</em><br />
So is a 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rule change needed in every event that has low participation? Is the
</em><br />
drop in 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; participation  a result of bad rules? One model dominence? Lack of
</em><br />
interest? 
<br />
<br />I can only speak for myself, and the reason that I didn't fly this
<br />
year is that I like to be competitive (doesn't always happen, but it
<br />
is a goal...) and I knew that without a Hosler it probably wasn't
<br />
going to happen, and I really didn't want to build another one... 
<br />
(Plus, I really dislike weight limits...  ;) )
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; sure that single design dominence is a factor. The fact is I don't
</em><br />
know the 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason,maybe the thing to do is to contact  the guys that used to
</em><br />
fly the 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; event and ask why they quit flying NO Cal. Might be a place to start
</em><br />
rather 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then starting to change rules in order to try and boost entrys .Just a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought. Seems we should first understand the nature of the  problem
</em><br />
before 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trying to fix it.
</em><br />
<br />Well, from Gary's posts, it would appear that at least two of us would
<br />
fly if something was changed...  Would the participation go to the
<br />
&quot;Golden Age of USIC&quot; levels...?  Probably not, but if any more
<br />
participation comes of it, it wouldn't be a bad thing, would it...???
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; A simple solution to the Hosler dilemma is to institute a maximum
</em><br />
wing 
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; area.........
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Possible but a bear to process due to wing planforms. EZB is easy
</em><br />
since it's 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a chord /span relationship.If the span  and chord are within limits
</em><br />
it's OK 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regardless of configuration.. Tapered wings ,elipitical wings etc
</em><br />
will all 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; add to the complexity of processing.IMOH...I like simple :-)
</em><br />
<br />Ditto on that one...  I think that might actually make matters worse,
<br />
although I do agree that it would &quot;solver the Hosler problem...&quot;
<br />
<br />Maybe it's not worth changing things...  and I surely haven't been
<br />
doing this as long as everyone else, and haven't seen the days of 1g
<br />
NC, but I would -think- that taking the weight limit off -completely-
<br />
would allow more possible designs into the mix...  The point about LPP
<br />
is a good one...  not too much difference in the designs, and it seems
<br />
to all come down to who is the best flyer...  I don't mind getting
<br />
beat (and it's good that I don't...) and for a class like LPP, which
<br />
-isn't- a model of a &quot;real&quot; plane, I don't mind...  but I just never
<br />
liked the situation of a class that -should- allow different planes
<br />
flying around brought down to one design primarily because of a rule
<br />
put in place that -obviously- didn't accomplish it's goal...  So I
<br />
consider a rule that didn't work to be one that should be abolished...  
<br />
