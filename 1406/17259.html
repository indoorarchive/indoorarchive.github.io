I think that would be simple to arrange, Don.
<br />

<br />
I do hope that JC comes back on-line first though.
<br />

<br />
Understand that this is a hanger built in '39, doors are welded shut and foamed in place. It has been outfitted as a warehouse. 
<br />
There has been no tenants for a decade. A local HS or college had used it for baseball or softball practice - there are remains of batting cages inside. Lots of leaves, lots of dust/dirt and it smells like an old building.
<br />
There is no water service currently, so we'd rent porta-potties or direct folks to the airport building where there is a bathroom. It is a long 'block' walk or very short drive. 
<br />
The airport manager was very helpful and outlined what they were expecting to do to make the place presentable. He plans to bring in a lift and clean up the hanging bit on the ceiling and tape over some apparent bullet holes in the windows. We will seal up gaps in the doors that lead directly into the hanger from outside.
<br />
It will be a lot nicer, but still not like JC. 
<br />

<br />
Costs for everything will likely be just shy of $1000 for three days.
<br />
For simplicities sake, I'd like to just divide this by number of contestants. OTOH, we should offer a lower rate for someone who only wants to fly one day. But in the end, we still need to come up with $1000.
<br />
And I don't want to be left holding the bag chasing down people (like it has been with the postage for the Toray carbon).
<br />

<br />
As for contest/time trial, I'd rather have it be really low key a la EAA or Kent. 
<br />

<br />
Lastly - We do not have to pay until after the event. 
<br />

<br />
So Aug 22-24 or Sept 12-15th? We just need to choose.
<br />

<br />
Also Champaign is only 10 or 11 miles away, so better hotels exist if you want them. Rantoul's are pretty basic from what I could see.
<br />

<br />
Regards.
<br />
Mike Kirda
<br />
P.S. Anyone have advice on PortaPotty location? We could have them placed inside the low area of the building but not in the hanger. I have no experience with these things, so no idea on the smell. Inside or Outside?<br />
