I agree with the Moderator’s comment; “What we do is benign, I suggest that we maintain that impression.” In the view of the FAA, outdoor FF is benign. The FAA’s concern, and the reason for the regs, is that through technology, civilians now have the capability to build UAVs (airplanes capable of being navigated via on-board cameras). That provides them the capability to deliver payloads to targets or perform surveillance at much greater distances than conventional R/C.
<br />

<br />
In reference to this comment: “Honestly this should be brought up to the AMA and/or NFFS. There are our representatives in all this - this is what we pay our membership dues for.” None of this discussion is new. From the initial FAA regulations proposal, AMA has been involved. The FAA engaged the AMA in ongoing discussions during the “proposed” period and if you remember, AMA invited members to comment and ask questions. Full scale acft vs. model strikes were not the focus of the discussion.
<br />

<br />
The reason the regs seem to be contrary to FF is that FF and CL are not even on the FAA’s radar (no pun intended). The AMA had the choice of bringing FF into the discussion but since “uncontrolled” vehicles were not of concern to the FAA, AMA elected to not open that can of worms.

I'd be more worried about the Canadian geese than a Lanzo.
<br />

<br />
But I don't see the FAA trying to regulate them much...
<br />

<br />
It is like the anti-wind turbine folks... Sure, they kill birds.
<br />
In comparison with the number killed by glass buildings though, the numbers are miniscule.
<br />
Yet I don't see anyone trying to legislate away glass buildings.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, the issue you bring up is valid. FF planes do occasionally end up OOS and would technically violate the regs. And being FF, we cannot pilot them out of the way of full sized aircraft.
<br />
Honestly this should be brought up to the AMA and/or NFFS.
<br />
There are our representatives in all this - this is what we pay our membership dues for.
<br />
I'll probably see John Lorbecki in two weeks and I'll be sure to mention it to him.
<br />

<br />
The ironic thing is the Bong Eagles picnic is at an airport and we are encouraged to fly there.
<br />
I'd be really curious what the FAA would think if we called them up...
<br />

<br />
