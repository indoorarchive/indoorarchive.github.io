<br />Don Deloach, I thought I *did* make my point, and not coyly,   But...
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;I'm guessing you wish to posit &gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />But since you wish to restate my intentions in your own words, I'm willng to argue the 
<br />
details with you.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;guessing you wish to posit that scheduling major indoor contests without regard to 
<br />
other major free flight activities is an okay idea.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />I am claiming the indoor community will be only spinning its wheels if we believe that a 
<br />
good solution will be accomplished by our starting to tap dance around SIX (6, VI, sexto) 
<br />
OUTDOOR FF contests held sometimes on  weekends that we may desire also.  Agreed, we 
<br />
should pay attention to dates of the outdoor Nats , but I believe the AMA does that 
<br />
already, at least in scheduling USIC/Indoor Nats.   There are only so many prime weekends 
<br />
in a year, defined for most of us as &quot;a 3 day weekend during possible good flying weather, 
<br />
when flying site available&quot;  Not coincidentally, these common factors leave both indoor FF 
<br />
and outdoor valuing some of the same weekends.  There are very few modelers who can  
<br />
attend both indoor and outdoor as competitors.  I can think of a couple-- Chuck Markos, 
<br />
you.  Oh, and the 10% of outdoor contestants waiting for us to enact non-conflicting 
<br />
contest schedules.  (That's sarcasm, not coyness.)
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;many outdoor FF flyers are not interested in indoor. But if
<br />
&nbsp;only 10% are then attendance at indoor contests would double. &gt;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />That's a pretty big &quot;if&quot;, and on what evidence do you base your &quot;new attendees windfall&quot; 
<br />
number?  Kibbie Dome Annual and USIC are not held during any of the major 6 outdoor 
<br />
contests you listed, (except a Lost Hills contest on Memorial Day.)  So where are the 10% ( 
<br />
or even 5%,) of new outdoor guys during our big two indoor events?  Point is, people tend 
<br />
to find a way to travel to and do what's important  to them, and &quot;better 
<br />
scheduling&quot; (though I'm all for that where possible and logical) will not be our silver bullet.   
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;Bottom line: The FF community is better served by indoor and outdoor leaders working 
<br />
together.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />My &quot;bottom line&quot; is that the indoor community needs more LOCAL flying to act as a feeder 
<br />
farms to grow interest which then results in competitive indoorists wanting to attend  
<br />
national level contests.  And local flying is the appropriate place to join forces with 
<br />
outdoor FF and/or indoor RC.   Sure, let's have fishing expeditions among other 
<br />
disciplines-RC, outdoor FF, train hobbyists-what have you-but *not* when it comes to 
<br />
scheduling of national level contests--those are sacred, and for grounded believers first, 
<br />
potential visitors second.  For national cnotests, no amount of optimal time scheduling, 
<br />
such as deference to outdoor or tap dancing for RC crowd will help us in the long run. 
<br />
<br />It's not a bad method either to do what is happening on this list--interested modelers 
<br />
polling each other and floating proposals to gauge interest,  This kind of interest is 
<br />
certainly more committed and depedable than putting faith in &quot;our leaders cooperating 
<br />
more with each other.&quot;   We have enough Chiefs, just not enough Injuns. We *are* 
<br />
cooperating.
