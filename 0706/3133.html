I think part of our difference in perception is due to you not being 
<br />
accustomed to the practice (&quot;&#x2026;I've seen only one flyer doing it in 
<br />
USA&#x2026;&quot;) and me seeing it a bunch.  It is a matter of familiarity.  You 
<br />
are considering winding at your table &quot;traditional&quot;, and I view 
<br />
hooking up an F1D out on the floor to be pretty standard.
<br />
<br />I guess it would all depend on the circumstances and the site.  In 
<br />
Slanic there are lots of places to launch, and it is not unusual to 
<br />
see several people getting ready to fly on the floor.  It is also not 
<br />
unusual to see two or more people next to each other.  When one is 
<br />
ready they launch and clear out.
<br />
<br />At USIC it is a bit tighter, but there is still room to launch even 
<br />
if someone is getting ready.
<br />
<br />I'll concede that I think actually winding in the middle of the floor 
<br />
is a bit unnecessary (although we did in Slanic w/o much problem).  I 
<br />
wind at my table, walk out w/ my winding setup and model, adjust the 
<br />
launch torque, hook up and launch.  Doesn't take too much time.
<br />
<br />But even if someone is &quot;homesteading&quot;, it doesn't seem to be too much 
<br />
of a problem.  Just because they are standing near a circle doesn't 
<br />
mean they've laid claim to it.  Nick Ray was fussing with his model 
<br />
out on the floor at USIC.  I brought my model out and launched near 
<br />
him.  My model was up first, so it got priority.  It didn't bother me 
<br />
that he was winding nearby.  When he was ready to launch I expected 
<br />
that he would make sure I was high enough or in a different circle.  
<br />
No biggie.
<br />
<br />I assume you had a bad experience with the one flyer you saw doing 
<br />
his business on the floor, right?  What happened?
