<br />
<br />I was browsing the web and came upon this article.  I'm not sure, but the
<br />
website seemed to suggest it was published in Time magazine.  
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Dave, you might want to include it in an upcoming Wing Tips, if there's
<br />
space.

<br /><br />Little Ships
<br />
<br /><br />In a cavernous armory in Manhattan, two days last week, a hundred-odd boys
<br />
of high-school age moved quietly about the floor, some carrying tiny,
<br />
fragile model airplanes, others standing with heads thrown back, gaping
<br />
anxiously at the roof. Up under the lofty girders, slowly and silently
<br />
circled little gossamer shapes. At intervals an announcer boomed a number
<br />
through a megaphone. The only other noise in the hall was an incessant
<br />
metallic undertone like the sound of a score of egg-beaters. This came from
<br />
a number of gadgets not unlike egg-beaters in the hands of some of the boys.
<br />
They were devices for winding the rubber-band motors of the little planes.
<br />
Such was the scene of the Eastern States indoor championship meet for
<br />
miniature ships, sponsored by The Universal Model Airplane News. 
<br />
<br />Three events were run off in the meet, all for flight duration. One was for
<br />
Baby R. O. G. (rise-off-ground) types, one for fuselage models, one for
<br />
&quot;open sticks.&quot; The Baby R. 0. G. class was limited to models of 30 sq. in.
<br />
maximum wing area, 8 in. length. One after another 20 &quot;babies&quot; took off from
<br />
the floor, made wide spirals toward the arched ceiling, propellers flailing
<br />
the air. One after another fluttered floorward, rubber motors slack, to land
<br />
on paper-thin balsa-wood wheels, until at the end of 7= min. only one was
<br />
still in the air for a new world record in its class. 
<br />
<br />The winning model, owned by Herbert Owen of New Britain, Conn., had an
<br />
enormous advantage of lightness. It weighed only .03 oz. Instead of Japanese
<br />
tissue, its wing was made of &quot;microfilm,&quot; a transparent, opalescent
<br />
substance that looks something like Cellophane. It is made from a
<br />
nitrocellulose fluid base (e.g. collodion, bronzing liquid, etc.)
<br />
that-floats on' water in a gossamer layer, dries in a sheet about one-eighth
<br />
the weight of superfine tissue. The winner was awarded the Sportsman Pilot
<br />
Cup, originally posted by Sportsman Pilot (monthly) for a race which did not
<br />
come off in the National Air Races last September. 
<br />
<br />The youth who won second place in the Baby R. O. G. class, Carl Goldberg,
<br />
20, of Purchase, N. Y., was regarded as the most important contender in the
<br />
meet. Now a student at University of Wisconsin, Goldberg has been building
<br />
and racing models in the U. S. meets for about five years, usually takes
<br />
highest honors. Younger boys speak of him with awe. Officials laud his
<br />
sportsmanship. 
<br />
<br />Planes in the fuselage class are larger than R. O. G.'s but not scale models
<br />
of full-sized airplanes. They have no landing gear, are launched from the
<br />
hand. Winner was John Zaic, 18, of Manhattan, with a flight of 6 min. 57
<br />
sec. Goldberg finished fourth. 
<br />
<br />Simplest of all flying; models is the &quot;open stick,&quot; in which the wings and
<br />
propeller are affixed to a single thin stick of balsa wood. This time
<br />
Goldberg seemed a sure winner when his plane had stayed up 13 min. But just
<br />
then it smacked into a rafter and spiralled to the floor. Goldberg elected
<br />
to waive its performance as a &quot;delayed flight&quot; in hope of improving his
<br />
time. But his next trial lasted only 9 min. 15 sec. Meanwhile a husky youth
<br />
in a black &amp; orange football sweater with a large &quot;9&quot; on his back, and a
<br />
baseball cap with a &quot;P&quot; on the-visor, had entered the lists. He was an
<br />
unknown, George Schweigart of National Park, N. J. Working feverishly at his
<br />
&quot;pit&quot; on the sidelines he had converted a fuselage type into an open-stick
<br />
just in time for the event. A moment before the start he broke the
<br />
cardboard-thin-propeller, carved from a single block of balsa. He bent the
<br />
propeller into place, launched it anyway. With grace and dignity the little
<br />
'ship flew for 10 min. 45 sec., won first place. 
<br />
<br />For his total points in all three events Goldberg emerged as usual, champion
<br />
of the meet. 
<br />
<br />Observers noted the deadly earnestness of the contestants. They gathered in
<br />
little groups, talking in terms of dihedral, torque, centre-of-gravity,
<br />
drag, wing-loading, etc., etc. Each construction job is a complete problem
<br />
in aerodynamics. 
<br />
<br />As in all indoor meets, models were bound to collide with something. Now and
<br />
then one would wedge itself among the rafters. If it could not be dislodged
<br />
by a toy balloon on a long string, its owner would calmly climb after it.
<br />
When the planes settle toward the heads of those on the floor, strict
<br />
etiquette must be observed: One must never jump hastily out of the way. That
<br />
disturbs the air currents and may cause a plane to dive to the floor. Proper
<br />
procedure is to swing one's head slowly, or squat gently.
