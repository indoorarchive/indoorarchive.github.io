Hi Don, 
<br />
<br />Having had my fair share of run-ins with non-indoor CDs, I can see where you and Mike are coming from in terms the rules being abundantly clear with regard to what the CD can and cannot do. 
<br />
<br />The goal in this case is to make each participant's models unique so that models, or parts of models cannot be shared by competitors. We ran into a situation last spring, where it was impossible to prove that models were being shared, yet many suspected that they were. 
<br />
<br />The license number is a convenient candidate because the competitors wear them at the world champs, and the timers use those numbers to match the fliers to the appropriate score cards. The rule change would ideally only add one more step, where the model is also matched to the fliers and the score cards. Names could be tricky if the competitor writes his or her name using non- Latin characters. As a I timer, I cannot tell you if a name written on the model in Chinese is the same as another name or not.
<br />
<br />The national number alone isn't sufficient because many countries seem to start with one, and so their could conceivably be overlaps. Nevertheless, if we use country code plus license number format, we'll get the right FAI numbers without having requiring the participant to have a current FAI card.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
<br />Nick

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Reading between the lines it seems there was some issue at the last WC that is bringing this topic up. I have no idea what happened so do not have the inside knowledge at what is driving the change. My concern is purely from a CD perspective. Right now I have to check AMA cards of contestants. So I currently see a potential in the proposal for FAI events that will require only a FAI license number on the model. No problem with that. But as a CD I would then ask to see your FAI card to assure that your number matched the FAI card and was current. I know the numbers are the same except for USA added but the difference becomes was the fee paid to FAI? I do not think we want to put contestants or CDs in the position to have to accept &quot;made up&quot; FAI numbers on a model to comply when no fee was paid and if adopted for F1L, F1R and F1M it may effect participation.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the intent is to simply identify a model and its owner, then Tapio's proposal seems to address it nicely by using either the FAI license or National number (AMA number). Otherwise the unintended consequence is that all FAI indoor modelers would have to buy a FAI stamp to then be issued their FAI number to then be able to write that number on the model. Yes a technicality of the current proposed wording but I am just pointing it out. Better to clarify now to reflect the actual intent instead of after :-)
