I just had a conversation with professor from Purdue University whom reached out to me concerning a new high school initiative for researching flight. A grant has been won by a group of high school teachers and they want to pursue replicating insect flight. As bleak as that might seem to us, they are very open to listening to what we can suggest to make the experience more rewarding for high school students.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;As part of the discussion, I asked if he could arrange getting the famous Purdue Armory for flight testing?
<br />
&nbsp;Yes, that is a very strong possibility!!
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Here are some of the issues we discussed-
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;1) The skill level needed to produce ornithopters that fly well enough to be be studied is very high and beyond most high school students. They currently have a plan to 3D model indoor ornithopters. So far no success due to wing loading issues and mechanism issues (no surprise here) 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;2) They are very aware of Wright Stuff. It can be part of the experience (as could P-18 and others)
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;3) Simpler aircraft (ie Wright Stuff) will increase skill levels for both building and trimming.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;4) Demonstrations of across the board indoor flight including indoor ornithopters?? Can we find enough people willing to drive to Purdue for showing the nuances of indoor flight? Can this be done before the snow flies? Any indoor contests coming up? West Baden, etc.? 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;5) Can someone find Roy White and see if he can still travel? Others flying ornithopters? I believe once we show an AMA indoor ornithopter's construction, the sooner we can guide the curriculum to sustainable success 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;with more conventional aircraft.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;6) I gave the the Purdue folks a simple ratio concept of learning. I told them that a Wright Stuff model will get them to &quot;70 %&quot; of their goal to understanding miniature flight in the time frames they expect. Focusing only on replicating insect flight might get them to &quot;10 %&quot; successful application and understanding.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;7) I will receive a curriculum outline shortly for review.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Seeing this from a HS teacher's and Purdue professor's perspective, they are expecting great things from the entomology department, biology department, mechanical and aeronautical engineering departments with their quest of studying and replicating insect flight. We need to be tactful and cautious not to upset their apple cart.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I know I am preaching to the choir but I want to get this right, really right, with Purdue. If we can help them get the curriculum workable and earn them education kudos, my bet is that we can groom this into a very nice symbiotic relationship with Purdue's Engineering department. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I am open to suggestions and any volunteers willing to come to demonstrate various flight vehicles.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Cheers,
<br />
&nbsp;Tom Sanders  
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
