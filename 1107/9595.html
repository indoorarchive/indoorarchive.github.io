<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know the details either, but the old record was 37 something, and the new one is 38 something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<br />I hadn't planned to write about the record flight - it was just practice for the team selection contest.  But, several people asked about it, so here it is.
<br />
<br />BTW - I was just ribbing Max about the &quot;I don't know the details&quot;.
<br />
<br />The old record was *almost* 38 minutes, at 37:58.  The new record is *just over* 38 minutes at 38:03 :)
<br />
<br />#7, aka Lucky Number Sleven, is my best model - about 2 minutes better than the rest (there are 4 of the current variation, and 8 in the Eidolon series).  I've been trying to warp the other three models in my box into #7.  I don't know exactly why Sleven is so much better.
<br />
<br />I flew #5 on Saturday with a heavy new prop (.26gm) that hadn't worked well in the past.  After a bunch of adjustments, it and the model were looking pretty good.
<br />
<br />Iacobellis and I launched about the same time.  He got about 20' higher, but #5 hung in like a champ.  It only needed a small bump at the end to clear a box on the floor, no other steers.
<br />
<br />1640 turns in a 9.5&quot; loop of 5/99 - stretched out to almost 10&quot; after the flight.  The plane peaked out at about 15 minutes, cruised for another 7 or so, and then began a slow descent.
<br />
<br />The prop started changing pitch at about 8 minutes and continued until about 25 minutes.
<br />
<br />RPMs went down to about 36 and climbed back up to about 48.
<br />
<br />#5 had been doing about 16:30 half motors.  For some reason my partial motors have been well below the full motor flights.  I used to freak out when everyone else was doing several minutes more than me on the partial motors.  I probably need to adjust something, but I haven't gotten around to it.
