Larry. 
<br />
 On you recods flight give an account of the flight
<br />
Yang
<br />
 
<br />
  First of all, I don’t mess with ¼ motor flights in ceilings over 100’ I prefer 
<br />
½ motor or ¾ motors flights and have found that quarter motor flights don’t 
<br />
equate to full motor flights in high ceillings. Quarter motor flights usually 
<br />
fly in the cooler ground air while ½ motor flights and get the benefit of the 
<br />
warmer upper air.
<br />
 
<br />
35:01 flight at lakehursr, 2007
<br />
 
<br />
The second or third ½ motor flights did 17:30 at an altitude of around 75’. I 
<br />
used a rather small symmetrical prop of 11.8” and a pitch of 19. The motor was 
<br />
5/99 .024x13 and weighed.36 gram. I wound in 3330 turns to a torque of.09 and 
<br />
backed off 90 and loaded the motor at .53 inch ounces. These light models need 
<br />
to be launched at a rather steep angle to keep the outboard wing from tucking 
<br />
under. The model climbed rather close to the ceiling but I don’t have any 
<br />
records of how long it staved there. I do remember that its let down time 
<br />
was quite long.  The model landed with 310 turns and that was the only official 
<br />
flight that I made with that model that day. I had two other records to shoot 
<br />
for the next day..
<br />
 For new indoor fliers don’t get carried away with building super light models. 
<br />
I usually spend a full day in selecting the wood for lightness and stiffness 
<br />
that is to be used in my next model. There’s so much more information on 
<br />
building and flying indoor models today than when I started 19 years ago.
<br />
 
<br />
 My first 30:00 EZB in 1993  weighed .83 gram and #34 did 34:00 at Akron and 
<br />
weighed .55 gram and that model did a no touch flight of 30:41 at Johnson City.
<br />
Larry Cailliau did 35+ at Tustin in the late 90’s and I can’t remember why that 
<br />
flight was declared unofficial , I believe that his model weighed over .5 grams.

Hi, Larry, Max,
<br />
<br />Good to hear from you guys.
<br />
<br />The 6&quot; 67 mg motor stick is originally part of a lighter 310 mg EZB. Max, if you 
<br />
recall, I had brought it to Lakehurst over Labor Day weekend. As it turned out, 
<br />
I switched the wing and prop from a heavier EZB, so that the total weight 
<br />
increased to 370 mg. That is how it appears in the INAV plan. For a 370 mg EZB, 
<br />
I would also put a little more heft into the motor stick. 
<br />
<br /><br />Keep in mind that the 30 minute flight at Lakehurst was one of its first flights 
<br />
and not yet trimmed perfect. It's difficult to determine what is its full 
<br />
potential. I believe on a good day at Lakehurst, 33+ is possible. We will see 
<br />
how it flies next summer at the hangar.
<br />
<br />I decided on a short motor stick because I thought it would better guard against 
<br />
motor stick bowing and twist, compared to a 7 or 8&quot; stick of similar density and 
<br />
stiffness. At the same time, I can lose a few 10's mg.
<br />
<br />So far, I see that my light motor stick, even though it is only 6&quot;, is sensitive 
<br />
to the tension and twist of the motor. I have to back off about 150 turns and 
<br />
launch at .08 to .09 in-oz. But this is still a very large amount of torque and 
<br />
more than enough to take the model to the top of Lakehurst and higher.
<br />
<br />For me, all of this is part of an ongoing experiment. My newest EZB weighs 310 
<br />
mg and has a 62 mg 6&quot; motor stick. Again, perhaps the stick is too short and too 
<br />
light. I just don't know and will do my best to experiment and find out.
<br />
<br />I know that Larry has written that a longer motor stick is needed for a long 
<br />
cruise. I have the utmost respect for Larry and have learned a lot from his 
<br />
articles. I find it interesting to experiment and try new things, and I will 
<br />
report my findings as I learn them.
<br />
<br />Max,
<br />
<br />Can you send me a copy of your 320 mg EZB plan? I would love to see it.
<br />
<br />Larry,
<br />
<br />On your ?
<br />
record flight, can you describe the flight profile? Time to climb, maximum 
<br />
altitude, cruise and descent times
<br />
Thank you.
<br />
<br />-Kang
