Re: Belgrade, Mark beat me to it!
<br />
<br /><br />I've been to Belgrade twice and I agree with everything Mark says. 
<br />
The city reminded me of Paris or one of the other big Northern 
<br />
European capitals and in particular, it seems to be a city for young 
<br />
people, with lots of well behaved, sober, student aged locals in the 
<br />
middle of town in the evenings.
<br />
<br />The Trade Fair complex is 2 or 3 miles away from the middle of the 
<br />
city and it's very quiet in August as there are no exhibitions at 
<br />
that time of year (hence the date of the Champs).
<br />
<br />Yes, Hall 3 is an unknown quantity as a flying site as I don't think 
<br />
it's been test-flown yet. Potentially, if the central light is 
<br />
removed and the air is calm, it could be very good indeed but it will 
<br />
be the same for all, whatever its like.
<br />
<br />The last serious danger in Belgrade was in the late '90's when NATO 
<br />
fighters bombed the city! In my previous visits, I felt much safer 
<br />
than I would in London these days. It is impossible to predict the 
<br />
future, but the recent disturbances seemed to be minor and confined 
<br />
to a small area. The Embassy area is well away from the centre and 
<br />
from the Trade Fair. Certainly, I never experienced any anti Brit' or 
<br />
anti Western sentiment in belgrade. As GBR TM again this time, I'll 
<br />
monitor the situation through our Foreign Offfice and the other usual 
<br />
channels.
<br />
<br />I haven't heard of any of the European flyers thinking of pulling out 
<br />
or not going.
<br />
<br />I would suggest to anyone planning go to:
<br />
<br />1. Avoid trying to park in the middle of the city as there is a 
<br />
fiendish and incomprehensible ticketing system that makes it very 
<br />
difficult.
<br />
2. Get rooms with air-con as it can be very hot in August.
<br />
<br />I hope to see you all there.
<br />
<br />Nick.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have been reading all of the World Champs comments and 
</em><br />
increasingly 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with pessimism creeping in. We are all free to have our own

opinions 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; however I thought it would be good to give an alternate perspective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from my personal experiences after spending 9 days at the European 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Champs Belgrade last summer. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Firstly the hospitality and courtesy of all of the Serbian fliers, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organizers and helpers was second to none. Any issues to do with 
</em><br />
our 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stay or the flying were always addressed swiftly and with a 
</em><br />
positive 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outcome. The local environment around the exhibition halls was 
</em><br />
quiet 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but still had a fair number of locals shopping and eating at the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; various outlets. The food and drinks were excellent within the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exhibition halls surroundings. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Belgrade itself is quite different from what I had expected, I had 
</em><br />
a 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; couple of reservations but these were so unfounded and soon 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forgotten. It is a vibrant city with lovely restaurants, bars and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; westernized shops. Large numbers of the locals promenade throughout 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the early evening and took no second glance at our party with our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; foreign language. Every evening we meandered through the streets 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; looking for our evening meal and beverages. We were always made 
</em><br />
very 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; welcome and I personally never felt any threat.   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I for one really enjoyed my stay in Belgrade and am excited to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; returning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I truly believe the Serbians as the Romanians and other Nations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before will do everything in their power to make this an enjoyable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; World Champs.
