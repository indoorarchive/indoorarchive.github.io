Hello Bill,
<br />
<br />Most of us in this group would agree with you that this person is
<br />
using the sprinkler system as an excuse to not change their
<br />
traditional venue of activities.  Proving to him that &quot;we&quot; know more
<br />
about his sprinkler system than he does is not the way to get him or
<br />
his supervisors to allow indoor free flight model in their facility. 
<br />
A better way might be to bring him a HLG, LPP or any type of sport
<br />
rubber powered model and get him excited about flying it himself. 
<br />
Then he could see there little danger to his sprinkler system from
<br />
these models.
<br />
<br />That said, I worked for a fire sprinkler manufacturer for more than 16
<br />
years and can give you a basic understanding of sprinkler systems and
<br />
fire sprinklers.
<br />
<br />First there are no mercury switches in fire sprinklers.  Mercury
<br />
switches are an electrical device and automatic sprinkler systems are
<br />
required to operate with no external power.  
<br />
<br />There are two types of fuses that set sprinklers off.  One is a solder
<br />
element, either under tension or compression.  The other is called a
<br />
glass bulb sprinkler that uses a fluid filled glass ampule.  It is
<br />
always under a compressive load.  The fluid in it is mostly glycerin
<br />
and some dye.  Both types must operate, without external power, when
<br />
the temperature at the fusible element reaches a specific set point. 
<br />
Contrary to Hollywood depiction, each sprinkler head operates
<br />
independent of all other heads.  Building owners and insurance
<br />
companies fear water damage as much as fire damage.
<br />
<br />All sprinkler heads installed in any U.S. facility are either Factory
<br />
Mutual or Underwriters Laboratories approved.  Probably both for a
<br />
governmental facility.  Some of the tests FM and UL put sprinklers
<br />
through include tumbling the sprinkler head in a drum with short
<br />
lengths of cut 2x4's.  After this test they must maintain their
<br />
structural integrity and operate properly.  Some test involve dropping
<br />
steel balls on the glass bulbs from specific heights and testing them
<br />
for proper operation.  The testing done by these laboratories
<br />
generally cost a manufacturer $750,000 to $1,000,000 to put a new
<br />
sprinkler head on the market.
<br />
<br />If you are interested in finding out if rubber powered model airplanes
<br />
have caused premature sprinkler head operation contact one of the
<br />
following three groups or all three.  Be very specific with your
<br />
questions.  General answers may not help you.
<br />
<br />National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) <a href="http://www.nfpa.org">http://www.nfpa.org</a>
<br />
Factory Mutual Global (FM)  <a href="http://www.fmglobal.com/">http://www.fmglobal.com/</a>
<br />
Underwriters Laboratories (UL)  <a href="http://www.ul.com/">http://www.ul.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Go to their contact us section and email their customer service or
<br />
technical people and ask them the question.  I am sure that most of
<br />
the U.S. facilities that allow indoor free flight have sprinkler
<br />
systems.  Most local building codes require them, particularly in
<br />
schools, gyms and other governmental recreation facilities.
<br />
<br />Use the information you get wisely.  As I said you are not going to
<br />
get the powers to be to allow indoor free flight because &quot;we&quot; know
<br />
more about their sprinkler system than they do.  If the sprinkler
<br />
system is really a major concern with them the information from NFPA,
<br />
FM or UL could set their mind at ease.  But, I doubt that the
<br />
sprinkler system is the problem.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
<br />Tom Juell
