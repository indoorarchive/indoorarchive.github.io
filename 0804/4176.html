<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Any AMA Cat II records broken at Kent State?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
You asked...here is the glider report.  As far as I know no other 
<br />
records were broken up to about 6:00 when I left.  Perhaps someone 
<br />
can let us know if anything interesting happend in the evening...
<br />
~Jim
<br />
<br />Competition close, but times disappoint. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The Showdown at Kent was close once again. 
<br />
The Fieldhouse was very warm and humid this year, it was 88 degrees 
<br />
inside.  Overall attendance was down due to: 
<br />
A) Gas prices 
<br />
B) First nice weather day of 2008 for Ohio 
<br />
C) Toledo Weak Signals show being held the same weekend  
<br />
D) All of the above? 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Nonetheless in the glider events Rob Romash, Kurt and Ken Krempetz 
<br />
and myself were all ready to go. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Early tests with my new big glider looked good.  Pretty early I was 
<br />
doing 53 second test flights with room on top.  Rob showed up with 
<br />
his fleet and was in the same range.  A failed rudder joint on one of 
<br />
my flights spelled disaster and caused wing damage upon impact.  I 
<br />
repaired the new one, but never got it back to where I wanted it. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Rob also struggled with his new glider &quot;BEYOGFOP&quot;.  We both tried to 
<br />
sort out our fleet from 7:30 until about 10:00.  At that point 
<br />
neither of us were happy with our times and took a break to fly 
<br />
catapult. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The Krempetz duo of Ken and Kurt (the elder Father and son) had a 
<br />
good battle going in Unlimited Catapult.  They ended .3 seconds off 
<br />
each other's times!  Kurt was on top with a 106.6 to Ken's 106.3 two-
<br />
flight total.  Rob went chasing them with his unlimited catapult, 
<br />
finally besting Kurt with a 110.1 to move into first. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I did not bring any unlimited catapults so I went up with my Standard 
<br />
catapult. Kurt had already put up some nice flights with a 51.0 and a 
<br />
52.7 for a 103.7.  I was flying my five-year-old model that set the 
<br />
record with a two flight total of 111.  Over the years the model had 
<br />
gained weight (as we all seem to).  I put it on a lightening routine 
<br />
and removed about .3 grams from the weight it was in 2003. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
After sorting out some launch problems that were my fault, (I forgot 
<br />
cat II gliders need a more shallow and baking launch than cat IV) I 
<br />
got it going well. At 2.8 grams it could barely get to the ceiling, 
<br />
which is the first thing you need to do.  I was pleasantly surprised 
<br />
with two final `go for broke flights&quot; of 54.5 and 55.1 to move into 
<br />
first overall with a 109.6 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I decided that with those kind of times I may as well fly my 12&quot; 
<br />
glider in unlimited as well.  After a couple blown &quot;greedy&quot; launches 
<br />
I got it grooved again and fired up a 55.4 and a 56.4.  Those 
<br />
actually upped my own record with the Standard Catapult glider by .8 
<br />
seconds.  It was also just enough to edge Rob for first place, with 
<br />
my 111.8 to his 110.1, but the edging was not over. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
At this point we had less than ten minutes left before glider was 
<br />
over.  I yelled to Rob &quot;we need to get some HLG flights in!&quot;  We both 
<br />
grabbed our gliders and put up one test flight and started hurling 
<br />
for officials as time was running out.  We stopped to check each 
<br />
other after I had seven of my nine in and Rob had 5 of his nine.  We 
<br />
had to do the math.  At that point I was holding a 53.7 and a 51.8 
<br />
for 105.5.  Rob had a 53.1 and a 52.3 for a 105.4!!!   
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Time was expiring, but we decided to fly until we were out of flights 
<br />
or we got stopped.  Kurt Krempetz had joined the fray as well 
<br />
launching his Tip Launch Glider with us.  It was quite a flurry of 
<br />
activity! 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
In his final three Rob put up a clutch 54.0 to take the lead by a 
<br />
second and a half. I had a 51.4 on my 8th launch, which did not help 
<br />
my total.  It was down to my ninth launch again to try to push Romash 
<br />
out of First.  I had to throw for the ceiling, which is a real 
<br />
possibility and instant doom in a Cat II building.  Rob was harassing 
<br />
me just as he did in 2007.  The launch felt great and looked good 
<br />
going up&#x2026;I may have done it!  But a large stall, followed by a tail 
<br />
slide?  My previously damaged nose had departed the glider on 
<br />
launch.  The glider did a falling leaf routine to the middle of the 
<br />
floor in 16.6 seconds.  The flight would count as zero thanks to 
<br />
having a dropped part, but that was not important.  In the rematch of 
<br />
the Clash in Kent it was Rob edging me for a well deserved win in 
<br />
HLG.  Neither of us got close to the FAI record, or our flights form 
<br />
last year.  We decided to blame it on the air instead of our arms or 
<br />
the gliders.  There is always next year&#x2026;we hope.   
<br />
