We had a great weekend at Lakehurst.  The storms of last week spared 
<br />
us and there were two days of great air and minimal drift.  As usual, 
<br />
the early hours (up to about 4pm) were best for getting things 
<br />
trimmed out and prepped.  Then, once the sun started filtering golden 
<br />
through the end doors in the evening, it was time to try for the epic 
<br />
flights.
<br />
<br />On Saturday, Doug Schaefer set a new F1D record of around 38:45, 
<br />
smashing the old mark by about 45 seconds.  Brett Sanborn broke it 
<br />
again on Sunday with an astounding 39:38.  Amazing!
<br />
<br />Molly Neering flew her F1D either 30 minutes or close to it, proving 
<br />
she is no flash-in-the-pan.  At one point she exclaimed, &quot;indoor is 
<br />
so QUIET!&quot;  Well, not anymore, Molley :)  It's great to have a new 
<br />
personality around.
<br />
<br />Jim Richmond, Max Zaluska, and I all worked on HLS.  Jim had a 
<br />
beautiful, and very light, looking model.  He and I both struggled 
<br />
for a while with a too-far-aft CG and ended up moving the wings back 
<br />
about an inch.  Unfortunately, when Jim was launching his first full 
<br />
motor flight his motorstick gave out and wrecked the model.  Jim was 
<br />
heard to comment, &quot;I guess I made it a little too light&quot;.
<br />
<br />Something about my new model is requiring a ton more power to fly, 
<br />
and that's not good.  The best ¼ motor flight I could manage was 
<br />
13:30.  As the weekend was winding down I figured I needed to at 
<br />
least put something up at the ceiling for fun.  The full motor flight 
<br />
did its predicted 54, but was a pleasure to watch.  I guess I've got 
<br />
some work to do for next time.
<br />
<br />Max was probably in the best shape w/ his HLS, doing a 14:45 ¼ 
<br />
motor.  His full motor flight was lost when the wing folded on a 
<br />
steer, however.
<br />
<br />I saw Nick Ray flying his Ministick a lot, and I think he ended up 
<br />
with a 13 something.  Jeff Hood did around 28 minutes with his EZB.  
<br />
And there were a couple others whose names unfortunately escape me at 
<br />
the moment.
<br />
<br />One of the base people stopped by to watch and commented that there 
<br />
were more of us than usual.  So I guess our little &quot;contest&quot; worked.  
<br />
Not huge numbers, but a comfortable and entertaining concentration.  
<br />
Join us next time!
