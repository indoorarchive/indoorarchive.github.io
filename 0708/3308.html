I thought that this is important sad news, so I am passing it to the 
<br />
group.
<br />
Edmund.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;If you look for the answers yourself, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will find that you can do better.&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
Dr Paul MacCready
<br />
<br /><br />Roger,
<br />
<br />* It is with great sadness that I notify modelers everywhere of the 
<br />
recent death of Dr Paul MacCready:
<br />
<br />As reported in LA Times, 8/30/07
<br />
<br />Martyn Cowley
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Paul B. MacCready, the Caltech-trained scientist and inventor who 
<br />
created the Gossamer Condor -- the first successful human-powered 
<br />
airplane -- as well as other innovative aircraft, has died. He was 81.
<br />
<br />MacCready died in his sleep at his Pasadena home Tuesday, according 
<br />
to an announcement from AeroVironment Inc., the Monrovia-based 
<br />
company he founded. The statement said he had been recently diagnosed 
<br />
with a serious ailment but the cause of death was not listed.
<br />
<br />An accomplished meteorologist, a world-class glider pilot and a 
<br />
respected aeronautical engineer, MacCready headed the team that 
<br />
designed and built the Gossamer Condor and the Gossamer Albatross -- 
<br />
two flimsy, awkward-looking planes powered by a furiously pedaling 
<br />
bicycle racer -- that won him international fame and $300,000 in 
<br />
prize money.
<br />
<br />He also built and flew a radio-controlled replica of a prehistoric 
<br />
pterodactyl, the largest creature that ever took to the air.
<br />
<br />His successes in these and other imaginative projects led to more 
<br />
than 30 prestigious awards, including the Collier Trophy for 
<br />
achievement in aeronautics and astronautics, and five honorary 
<br />
degrees.
<br />
<br />The slight, pale, bespectacled MacCready said it all probably stemmed 
<br />
from a rather nerdy childhood.
<br />
<br />&quot;I was always the smallest kid in the class,&quot; he told the National 
<br />
Aviation Hall of Fame. &quot;I was not especially coordinated -- certainly 
<br />
not the athletic type -- and socially immature.
<br />
<br />&quot;And so, when I began getting into model airplanes, and getting into 
<br />
contests and creating new things, I probably got more psychological 
<br />
benefit from that than I would have from some of the other typical 
<br />
school things,&quot; he said. &quot;Nobody seemed to be quite as motivated for 
<br />
the new and strange as I was.&quot;
<br />
<br />There were those who denigrated MacCready's efforts, saying they had 
<br />
no practical value. He said his critics missed the point.
<br />
<br />&quot;Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic did not directly advance 
<br />
airplane design,&quot; MacCready said. &quot;The plane was a lousy plane. It 
<br />
was unstable and you couldn't see forward very well. You wouldn't 
<br />
want to design another like it. But it changed the world by being a 
<br />
catalyst for thinking about aviation.&quot;
<br />
<br />Lindbergh's plane, the Spirit of St. Louis, hangs today from a 
<br />
ceiling at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in 
<br />
Washington, D.C. Hanging next to it is MacCready's Gossamer Condor.
<br />
<br />MacCready's foray into aviation history began as the result of a bad 
<br />
loan.
<br />
<br />In 1970, MacCready guaranteed a loan for a friend who wanted to start 
<br />
a business building fiberglass catamarans. When the company failed, 
<br />
MacCready found himself $100,000 in debt.
<br />
<br />Casting around for a way to deal with that problem, he recalled a 
<br />
cash prize offered by British industrialist Henry Kremer to anyone 
<br />
who built a human-powered plane capable of sustained, controlled 
<br />
flight.
<br />
<br />&quot;The Kremer prize, in which I'd had no interest, was just about equal 
<br />
to my debt,&quot; MacCready said. &quot;Suddenly, human-powered flight seemed 
<br />
important.&quot;
<br />
<br />To win the prize, he had to create an airplane that could take off on 
<br />
its own and fly a figure-eight, 1.15-mile course, clearing 10-foot 
<br />
hurdles at the beginning and end. Several people had tried; all had 
<br />
failed.
<br />
<br />MacCready said he studied the soaring flights of hawks and vultures, 
<br />
calculating the amount of lift needed to keep the birds aloft and 
<br />
comparing that with what he knew about gliders.
<br />
<br />He concluded that if he could triple the wingspan of a glider without 
<br />
increasing its weight, the power needed to keep it aloft in level 
<br />
flight would be only about four-tenths of one horsepower. He knew 
<br />
that a well-conditioned athlete could produce about that, and maybe a 
<br />
little more, for an extended period.
<br />
<br />The spindly, translucent Gossamer Condor that resulted was crafted of 
<br />
aluminum tubing, plastic sheeting, piano wire and Scotch tape. It had 
<br />
a wingspan of 90 feet but weighed only 70 pounds. The pilot was Bryan 
<br />
Allen, a strong, slender bicycle racer who powered the single 
<br />
propeller by pedaling a drive chain made largely of old bicycle parts.
<br />
<br />The Condor flew from the outset, but not well. However, because it 
<br />
flew so slowly and at such a low height -- about 10 mph and about 15 
<br />
feet -- MacCready was able to improve its design through trial and 
<br />
error.
<br />
<br /><br />The bizarre aircraft crashed scores of times during flight tests, but 
<br />
Allen always emerged relatively unscathed. MacCready noted dryly that 
<br />
his crash-and-rebuild system worked all right for the Condor, &quot;but it 
<br />
is not the way to develop airliners.&quot;
<br />
<br />Finally, on Aug. 23, 1977, the Condor made a successful seven-minute 
<br />
flight over a figure-eight course laid out around the airport in the 
<br />
dusty San Joaquin Valley farming town of Shafter. MacCready claimed 
<br />
the Kremer prize and was celebrated as the father of human-powered 
<br />
flight.
<br />
<br />&quot;We're at last achieving a goal that man has had for thousands of 
<br />
years,&quot; he said.
<br />
<br />Within months, Kremer had offered a prize of about $213,000 for the 
<br />
first human-powered flight across the English Channel.
<br />
<br />MacCready immediately began improving the Condor. What emerged was 
<br />
the Gossamer Albatross, which he described as a &quot;next-step clone.&quot;
<br />
The biggest difference was its stronger, lighter frame, made of 
<br />
carbon fiber tubing instead of aluminum.
<br />
<br />On June 12, 1979, with Allen at the pedals, the Albatross took off 
<br />
from Folkestone, England, and headed east. Fighting head winds and 
<br />
turbulence for the better part of three hours, Allen overcame cramps 
<br />
and exhaustion to land successfully on the beach at Cap Gris-Nez, 
<br />
France.
<br />
<br />Kremer called it a &quot;splendid achievement&quot; and handed over the prize 
<br />
money.
<br />
<br />Six months later, MacCready's ultralight Gossamer Penguin, powered by 
<br />
a 2.75-horsepower motor that ran on electricity generated by solar 
<br />
panels atop the fuselage, skimmed over the Arizona desert in the 
<br />
first climbing flight powered by sunlight.
<br />
<br />In 1981, a similar plane, MacCready's Solar Challenger, flew 180 
<br />
miles from Paris, France, to Kent, England. A few years later, 
<br />
another of his human-powered aircraft, the Bionic Bat, won two more 
<br />
Kremer prizes.
<br />
<br />In one of his greatest flights of fancy, MacCready then enlisted the 
<br />
help of engineer Henry Jex to create and fly a wing-flapping, radio-
<br />
controlled, half-scale replica of a pterodactyl, a creature with a 36-
<br />
foot wingspan that last soared over Mesozoic landscapes more than 60 
<br />
million years ago.
<br />
<br />&quot;If you can make something that moves around but gives you the 
<br />
feeling of a prehistoric creature, then people experience it; they 
<br />
feel it much better,&quot; MacCready said in a magazine interview.
<br />
<br />In 1987, his GM Sunraycer, a streamlined vehicle the size of a 
<br />
soapbox derby entry, easily won a 1,867-mile race in Australia 
<br />
against other, larger, solar-powered cars.
<br />
<br />Some of his later creations were big, like the Helios, an unmanned, 
<br />
solar-powered plane with 14 electric motors and a 200-foot wingspan 
<br />
that climbed to more than 96,000 feet. It was the highest altitude 
<br />
ever achieved by a propeller-driven aircraft.
<br />
<br />Some were small, like his surveillance planes, the size of a man's 
<br />
hand, that carried tiny television cameras.
<br />
<br />Some didn't work, like a little plane powered by a hamster.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hamsters are lazy,&quot; he lamented.
<br />
<br />The son of a prosperous physician, Paul Beattie MacCready was born in 
<br />
New Haven, Conn., on Sept. 29, 1925.
<br />
<br />By the time he was 14, he had designed and built a number of 
<br />
unconventional model planes, including an autogyro that flew for more 
<br />
than 12 minutes, outlasting the best efforts of adults entered in the 
<br />
same competition. Two years later, he tried his hand in real 
<br />
airplanes, earning a pilot's license.
<br />
<br />He entered Yale in 1943, at the same time signing up for training as 
<br />
a Navy pilot. His studies were interrupted occasionally by flight 
<br />
training, but World War II ended before he graduated; he never saw 
<br />
combat.
<br />
<br />In 1947, MacCready bought an Army surplus glider and, combining his 
<br />
Navy flight skills with his Yale training in meteorology, he soon 
<br />
became an expert glider pilot. He invented a system that is still 
<br />
used to calculate optimum flight speeds between thermal air currents.
<br />
<br />A year later, MacCready earned a master's degree in physics at 
<br />
Caltech and won the first of three national soaring championships.
<br />
<br />In 1951, he founded Meteorology Research Inc., which quickly became a 
<br />
leader in weather modification technology and the manufacture of 
<br />
remote-controlled aircraft for atmospheric research.
<br />
<br />MacCready received a doctorate in aeronautics from Caltech in 1952, 
<br />
and in 1956, he became the first American to win the World Champion 
<br />
Soaring Contest.
<br />
<br />Several years later, he founded AeroVironment, which produces 
<br />
electronic systems, surveillance aircraft and experimental, energy-
<br />
efficient cars and boats. The firm also builds systems to monitor and 
<br />
reduce air pollution and hazardous waste.
<br />
<br />MacCready often stressed the importance of independent thought.
<br />
<br />&quot;You will find that your teachers are sometimes wrong,&quot; he told a 
<br />
group of Santa Monica schoolchildren in 1998.
<br />
<br />&quot;Your parents will be wrong. Your schools will be wrong. If you look 
<br />
for the answers yourself, you will find that you can do better.&quot;
<br />
<br />Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann, a close friend, attributed 
<br />
MacCready's creativity to his outlook.
<br />
<br />&quot;He approaches nature and daily life with an innocent sense of 
<br />
wonder,&quot; Gell-Mann told Time magazine in 1990.
<br />
<br />&quot;He approaches problems and learning about new things in the same
<br />
way: without strongly held, preconceived notions. When he sees 
<br />
something, he takes a fresh view of it.&quot;
<br />
<br />MacCready is survived by his wife, Judy; three sons, Parker, Tyler 
<br />
and Marshall; and two grandchildren.
