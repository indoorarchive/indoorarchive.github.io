Congratulations on excellent flying. Was there any ceiling bashing or all no touch? How nice not to have to steer much!

&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: [Indoor_Construction] Lakehurst Aug 11-12
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a great weekend at Lakehurst. The storms of last week spared 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;us and there were two days of great air and minimal drift. As usual, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the early hours (up to about 4pm) were best for getting things 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;trimmed out and prepped. Then, once the sun started filtering golden 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;through the end doors in the evening, it was time to try for the epic 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;flights.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday, Doug Schaefer set a new F1D record of around 38:45, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;smashing the old mark by about 45 seconds. Brett Sanborn broke it 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;again on Sunday with an astounding 39:38. Amazing!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Molly Neering flew her F1D either 30 minutes or close to it, proving 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;she is no flash-in-the-pan. At one point she exclaimed, &quot;indoor is 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;so QUIET!&quot; Well, not anymore, Molley :) It's great to have a new 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;personality around.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim Richmond, Max Zaluska, and I all worked on HLS. Jim had a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;beautiful, and very light, looking model. He and I both struggled 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;for a while with a too-far-aft CG and ended up moving the wings back 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;about an inch. Unfortunately, when Jim was launching his first full 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;motor flight his motorstick gave out and wrecked the model. Jim was 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;heard to comment, &quot;I guess I made it a little too light&quot;.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Something about my new model is requiring a ton more power to fly, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and that's not good. The best ¼ motor flight I could manage was 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;13:30. As the weekend was winding down I figured I needed to at 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;least put something up at the ceiling for fun. The full motor flight 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;did its predicted 54, but was a pleasure to watch. I guess I've got 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;some work to do for next time.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Max was probably in the best shape w/ his HLS, doing a 14:45 ¼ 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;motor. His full motor flight was lost when the wing folded on a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;steer, however.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw Nick Ray flying his Ministick a lot, and I think he ended up 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;with a 13 something. Jeff Hood did around 28 minutes with his EZB. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And there were a couple others whose names unfortunately escape me at 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the moment.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the base people stopped by to watch and commented that there 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;were more of us than usual. So I guess our little &quot;contest&quot; worked. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not huge numbers, but a comfortable and entertaining concentration. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Join us next time!
<br />
