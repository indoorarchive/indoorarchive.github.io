Tom, I think the press release I created below was printed in John's 
<br />
article of MA for the 2007 results.  
<br />
<br />2008 results are not completed, and results have been scarce.  For 
<br />
whatever reason the Indoor Cups have not been a huge success.  Many 
<br />
have no idea what they even are.  I will take partial blame for not 
<br />
being a good enough promoter I suppose.  I got them rolling with John 
<br />
Kagan and Rex Hinson's help.  Rob Romash is now the director with me 
<br />
as his assitant.  I have been looking to get new blood and a better 
<br />
promoter to take my place with no takers.  Anyone, anyone?
<br />
<br />&quot;The 2007 Indoor National Cup has again come to a close.  
<br />
<br />The Indoor National Cups are sponsored by the National Free Flight 
<br />
Society.  The basic idea is to allow indoorists from across the 
<br />
country to compete in a year long points series for top honors in 
<br />
each of the two major disciplines, Indoor Rubber and Indoor Glider.
<br />
<br />There were seven regional contests to choose from this year, which 
<br />
was down two from 2006 unfortunately.  Up to six regional events can 
<br />
be used by each flier for points in addition to either of the 
<br />
two &quot;biggies&quot;, The Kibbie Dome annual or The United Sates Indoor 
<br />
Championships.  Contestants that place in the top five in any event 
<br />
will receive National Cup Points.  The points are weighted based upon 
<br />
the number of entrants in the particular event.
<br />
<br />Rob Romash beat out Tom Sova for top spot in the Rubber event, which 
<br />
includes F1L, Limited Pennyplane, and Ministick.  Rob placed well in 
<br />
both of his local regional contests (Colorado Springs) and traveled 
<br />
to Kent, Ohio to help his score.  Those three regional events plus a 
<br />
strong showing at the Kibbe Dome annual gave him a point total of 281.
<br />
<br />The Indoor Glider Cup pulls scores from Hand Lunched Glider, Standard 
<br />
Catapult, and Unlimited Catapult.  Rob Romash came within three 
<br />
points of taking both cups, but was edged out but perennial winner 
<br />
Kurt Krempetz for the Glider honors.  Kurt was one of few people to 
<br />
achieve three scores at one location. It should be noted that only 
<br />
two scores per location count towards an individuals point totals.  
<br />
Kurt had five regional scores plus his scores at USIC to edge take 
<br />
the win with 271 total points. 
<br />
<br />Congratulations to all of the winners.  Contest directors, now is the 
<br />
time to get your 2008 event added to the schedule.  You never know 
<br />
what out of towner may travel across country in hopes of picking up a 
<br />
few more points!  Information and applications for inclusion can be 
<br />
found at
