I understand the perception thing, but I think this is a case where perception is 180 degrees wrong. Since Mylar became legal for Wright Stuff models I've mentored many teams. Most of these kids had never built a model before. I don't think we've ever had a failure in the covering operation or even ever had a bad covering job.
<br />
<br />The 1.2g weight limit for A-6 coupled with the requirement for paper covering actually makes a competitive A-6 pretty difficult to build. Experienced builders with good wood can do it of course, but there are several pretty good local fliers around here who have never been able to get down to 1.2g.
<br />
<br />In the original spirit of A-6 as a &quot;beginner&quot; model (I love that term) I think going to Mylar would make the event more popular and would even the playing field a little for newbies by making it easier to build to weight. And - making that change wouldn't affect some of the real problems of the class - like getting motors to unwind without tangling.
<br />
<br />The A-6 is a great little model. Now let's talk about the new Super A-6 class...........(just kidding.....maybe....)

<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;While film does have some advantages, not the least of which is no warping from shrinking paper &amp; weight savings (allowing more weight in the wood structure) I believe A6 was &amp; still is intended to appeal to new comers to indoor &amp; film is preceived as requiring additional skills &amp; /knowledge. The preception part of this should not be under estimated. If you build a lot of film covered models then you would probably not agree with me, but if you got your start in indoor free flight by building tissue covered planes (scale, no-cal, AMA cubs, etc.) you MIGHT see film as more difficult or more advanced &amp; be less likely to give duration flying a chance. Also, tradition has something to do with it too. I think A6 is unique in that the rules were intended to create an event that was simpler &amp; faster to build than the existing duration events for a novice. The addition of a minimum weight &amp; elimination of the 1/32&quot; minimum prop shaft size were the only significant changes to the original rules.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You may recall, a group was formed a few years ago to &quot;standardize or unify&quot; the A6 rules. Eventually, we came up with a set of rules which we suggested be adapted by the USIC &amp; other groups flying A6. To this day, the USIC has not adopted these rules, which would not have made anyone's A6 that I am aware of obsolete. Yes, I understand that using film would not prevent someone from using paper, but as soon as the more experienced flyers started using film it would be perceived by new comers as being the correct way.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Momentum is a wonderful thing.

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing the A-6 rules to allow film would be a wonderful idea in my opinion. However this is complicated by the fact that there are no official rules for A-6 other than what people have decided to use. If there is a way to make this chamge I will be happy to do anything I can to help the process.
