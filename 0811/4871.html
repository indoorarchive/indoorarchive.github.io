<br />
I'm going to jump in here, since I jumped in on the discussion of A-6
<br />
rules years ago...  I have always found that in coming to a consensus
<br />
to an issue, all parties have to at least agree on the primary
<br />
objective...  And I think that it is universally agreed that the Prime
<br />
Objective for A-6 was for it to be a beginner's class...  So the rest
<br />
will follow from that point...
<br />
<br />First, a beginner's class should have dimensions and structure that
<br />
will allow a new indoor participant to progress without too much
<br />
difficulty...  the original A-6 &quot;rules&quot; that were proposed decades ago
<br />
by Mather seemed to have held the test of time, and I don't think that
<br />
the dimensional rules should be modified...
<br />
<br />However, the size of the required strips for construction -should- be
<br />
modified, in my opinion...  I cut my own wood, and have dozens of 4#
<br />
blocks sitting around...  So I can cut 4# wood for an A-6 and have
<br />
what I need...  However, a &quot;beginner&quot;, (who is what we are
<br />
targeting...) would have to buy expensive indoor sheets to get to
<br />
weight since the limits are for 1/16&quot; square structure wood...  I
<br />
would rather see a limit of 1/32&quot;, if any, for all components, which
<br />
means that you could go to almost any hobby shop and get a decent
<br />
sheet of 1/32&quot; or 1/20&quot; and build from that...  or surely you could
<br />
order a few sheets from National Balsa in contest grade and get one
<br />
that would be good...  This change would make it easier to find decent
<br />
wood for the class, and really what is the difference (in handling)
<br />
between a 1/16&quot; square spar and a 1/20 x 1/16&quot; spar of heavier
<br />
wood...?  Is one &quot;harder&quot; to handle for a beginner...?  I really don't
<br />
think so...
<br />
<br />Also, I would (for the same reasons...) be in favor of allowing film
<br />
for covering...  You could then have a heavier structure, which makes
<br />
it more durable (good for beginners...) and film in my opinion is no
<br />
harder to handle than condenser paper...  if not easier...  I have
<br />
worked with a few &quot;newbie&quot; indoor fliers, that have built ministicks
<br />
and SO with film, and like Bill, haven't seen any major obstructions
<br />
on the use of film...  
<br />
<br />Those two changes would make it easier and more affordable for someone
<br />
to build and fly in this event, and like I said earlier, isn't that
<br />
the purpose, if this is -really- a &quot;beginner's&quot; event...?
<br />
<br />I also don't think that these changes would make a bit of difference
<br />
for the &quot;expert&quot; fliers in the event...  Like mentioned in other
<br />
posts, the biggest problem is with motor bunching, at least from my
<br />
experience and watching the winners at USIC...  
<br />
<br />My few cents worth...  Curious to see if anyone else agrees...

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have always agreed with the argument about the difficulty of

finding  good 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wood in local hobby stores. We don't have any local sources of good

&nbsp;balsa.
