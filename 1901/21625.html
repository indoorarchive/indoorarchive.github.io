Don,
<br />
<br />I'm not condoning Leo going around you and the organizing committee.
<br />
However, the fact that he did it is an indication that he didn't feel
<br />
heard. When people don't feel heard and respected, they don't show up to
<br />
contests. I'm sure he was in similar situations at various points while he
<br />
helped organize the World Champs, although he never publicly threatened to
<br />
ban anyone for talking to the hotel, jury, or sponsors.
<br />
<br />As an AMA AVP, I'm concerned the Round Valley Dome event is going to be a
<br />
regional contest, even if it is well attended by locals. Based on the posts
<br />
here from several top level competitors, I think that is a valid concern.
<br />
Kibbie has a better track record of drawing high quality indoor competitors
<br />
from around the country. Back in the days of Johnson City, the best
<br />
competitors in the country went head to head each year. I don't feel like
<br />
we've had that level of participation in several years. I think a key
<br />
ingredient for that is a world class flying site, with ample time to
<br />
compete, that leads those most involved with our hobby to drop what they
<br />
are doing and come.  So, I'm simply asking whether or not we have gotten to
<br />
a point where the needs of the sport fliers, and the needs of the &quot;Indoor
<br />
Elitists&quot; are too far apart to be met by the same venue. If that is where
<br />
we are, let's own it and move forward while there is still plenty of time.
<br />
I'd rather see both groups separate than continue watching this game of who
<br />
can boycott the other's event most thoroughly.
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
<br />Nick Ray

<br /><br /><br />Is it time to once again separate USIC and the NATs? It sounds the concerns
<br />
of those intending to fly official AMA events are not being adequately
<br />
addressed. Perhaps, the AMA NATs should be held at Kibbie instead, and USIC
<br />
should be held at The Round Valley Dome.

<br /><br /><br />I, Leo Pilachowski of Bloomington, Indiana, am the individual that Don
<br />
DeLoach has referred to in his recent post.
<br />
<br />On Friday morning of last week (1/18/2019) I sent one and only one email to
<br />
the publicly available and published email address of the Round Valley Dome
<br />
event manager.  The email addresses are readily and prominently published
<br />
on the local school district website.  The email was to the point and
<br />
polite.  The email asked what the cost of using the lights would be if the
<br />
lights could be turned on.  It should be noted that I asked the very same
<br />
questions of Don DeLoach.  His first answer was that I should stop asking
<br />
such questions for the good of the sport.  After my obvious but polite
<br />
reply to such an email, Don DeLoach said that he would not answer any of my
<br />
questions.  One recourse was to ask the primary source directly and I did
<br />
so.
<br />
<br />One email is not pestering by any means at all and would not be considered
<br />
so by any reasonable person.
<br />
<br />The only rules that apply to an individual competing at Nats are those that
<br />
apply to all competitors.  The only rules are the AMA rules and regulations
<br />
as published and the published and approved supplemental regulations. This
<br />
notice and threat by Don DeLoach is a result of my reminding John Lorbeiki,
<br />
the NFFS president, that rules need to be published (or how would  anyone
<br />
know that a rule was being broken).  This reminder was in response to a
<br />
similar threat of further actions by John Lorbeiki in a private email to me.
<br />
<br />I think that this is just feigned public outrage and an attempt to steer
<br />
the discussion away from the real issues, including scheduling and
<br />
lighting, among other matters, that concern the 2019 Nats.  We all should
<br />
not respond well to bullies.
