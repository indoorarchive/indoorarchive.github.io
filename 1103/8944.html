<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tapio, how do you test your rubber? Windup or stretch? Details.
</em><br />
<br />First of all, I test full 30 gram F1B motors. By stretching, the method 
<br />
is adapted from Bror Eimar, but to my understanding originates from Fred 
<br />
Pierce. I pull the motor to estimated 90% of breaking load, then unload 
<br />
and record the pull force as a function of stretch. Summing these 
<br />
measures integrates the force over stretch, giving energy return.
<br />
<br />The original Eimar method used a lookup table to find the load/stretch 
<br />
combination for 90% of breaking load (the longer the motor is stretched, 
<br />
the lower the force. I found this complicated to use, so it was one 
<br />
major reason to build a computerized system. While unloading, Eimar took 
<br />
readings at steps of 10 or 20 cm, and again I felt that this number of 
<br />
datapoints is too coarse to get good results.
<br />
<br />I built the system almost 15 years ago. Did not know how to use 
<br />
microcontrollers then, so I used a computer mouse as the 
<br />
interface/AD-converted. The force is measured by a large spiral spring, 
<br />
that stretches about 3in under the full load of about 45 kiloponds 
<br />
(100lb). The movement of the spring goes around a pulley, and this 
<br />
rotational movement is taken via a rubber belt to one of the tiny axes 
<br />
of the mouse. So force = mouse movement. The other axis of the mouse, or 
<br />
rather the optoforks measuring the movement, are moved to a boat winch, 
<br />
whose movement (rotations) are measured. My software compensates for the 
<br />
spring stretch shortening the rubber motor, and the changing diameter of 
<br />
the winch drum, as the belt is wound around it.
<br />
<br />The Eimar tables used the motor unstretched length, stretch factor and 
<br />
the pull force. In practise, the unstretched length is not needed, as 
<br />
always the unstretched times stretch factor, i.e. the stretched length 
<br />
is used. So the table sums up into a simple equation, for a given 
<br />
stretch it calculates the force that equals the target load on the 
<br />
motor, and my software compares this to the measured, and instructs me 
<br />
to keep stretching the motor until the target is met (with more stretch 
<br />
the target force is reduced and actual force on the motor increased). 
<br />
Reaching the target, I start unloading, and the software measures the 
<br />
force and stretch, stores force at steps of 1cm, and sums these up to 
<br />
integrate the energy return.
<br />
<br />I do not break motors to find the actual breaking load for each batch, 
<br />
but assume this to be constant. I have been considering this, but ended 
<br />
up to the way I do it for a few reasons. First of all my rig measures 
<br />
only full F1B motors, so it would waste a lot of rubber to do 
<br />
destructive testing, and further I do not know if the rig would stand a 
<br />
repeated load from breaking motors. Second, I consider that when using 
<br />
the motors I wind them to more or less the same load/torque anyway, so 
<br />
this assumption is more in harmony with my actual use of the motors. 
<br />
Sort of test the motors for their intended use, not for maximum 
<br />
potential energy return. On the other hand, I think the difference is 
<br />
slight.
<br />
<br />My testing suggest very small variation of energy return within a batch, 
<br />
or at least within the box I have tested, even when I cross a boundary 
<br />
from one rubber sheet to another. Therefore I feel that testing 
<br />
individual motors is futile. However, I get the stretched length for 
<br />
each motor to use as reference for expected maximum turns. Also I get 
<br />
some nice comparison data for different batches. I am convinced that my 
<br />
measurements are valid, as even though the energy return within a batch 
<br />
stays constant, for different batches tested on the same session I get 
<br />
different readings, so my rig is NOT producing just similar figures for 
<br />
the same session!
<br />
<br />I also use the same rig to break in the motors. This time 80%, keep the 
<br />
motor under stretch for 4 minutes, slightly increasing the stretch while 
<br />
the motor breaks in and the pull force is reduced. Then let the motors 
<br />
rest until the next day before the test.
<br />
