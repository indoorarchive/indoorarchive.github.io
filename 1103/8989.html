In about 1962 or so, we were flying an indoor contest in the NAS Dallas Drill Hall (some of you might remember it from the Navy Nats held at NAS Dallas).
<br />
I was flying a helicopter that had the top rotor driven by a rubber motor and the bottom rotor driven by the torque of the top rotor.  There was a peg protruding from the top rotor so that the model could reach the ceiling and keep the top rotor clear. At that time I was the AMA senior national record holder and was trying to up the record.  My timer was the late Bud Tenny.  I launched the model and it climbed briskly to the top of the building and the peg engaged the ceiling and the flight was going according to plan.  After a few minutes the top rotor ceased turning and at point in time my timer declared the model to be hung up.  Thinking quickly I told Bud, no it isn't hung up the thrust of the bottom rotor is keeping it up there.  He protested but kept the watch running.  I was hoping for a gust of wind to come along and knock it down as I knew it was hung up, but if I could convince Bud it was flying I could have a super record.  Well, the wind never came and as the motor ran down it was clear to all the model was hung up.  It took several taps with a balloon to get it down.  Bud had made the right call and frankly, I don't know what I would have done if the model had fallen free.  I suspect i would have not applied for the record as it was obvious upon examination of the model that it had been captured by a cobweb.  Any protest would have not ruled in my favor.  In fact I was simply pulling Bud's leg.  We still get a good laugh about this story after all these years.

In Bill's case, he has called it correctly.

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I agree with Bill. This rule loophole needs to be closed if it isn’t already.
<br />

<br />
To muddy the waters further, there is a precedent in AMA Helicopter, going back 45+ years. I’ll now ask Jerry Murphy (now Chairman of the FF Contest Board) to weigh in.

<br /><br /><br />My understanding is that in the 2 state finals I'm familiar with the top rotor locked into either a ceiling tile or a light fixture. 
<br />
The copter then stayed there until the torque dropped enough for it to fall free.
<br />
<br />The kid I was helping had his copter hang the top rotor on a practice flight. It took over 10 minutes for the bottom rotor to stop. In his case the copter didn't fall so it wouldn't have been a legal flight (I guess).
<br />
<br />So I don't think we're talking about an aerodynamic phenomena. The copter is being supported by the ceiling - not by the thrust from the bottom rotor.
