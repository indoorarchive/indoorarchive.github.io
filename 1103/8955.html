Makes you wonder why those F1B guys kept their motors in coolers and shaded 
<br />
&nbsp;them during winding(?).  Well, some rubber is really heat sensitive  too.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The whole article touches on some good info and Fred it probably one of the 
<br />
&nbsp;best rubber polymer guys I've talked to.  I also suspect that if you  
<br />
slobber spray lube on your motor, I use &quot;Armor All,&quot; it would act as a cooling  
<br />
agent too.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Ahhh....that magic blend of natural and synthetic...it's everywhere.

<br />Several years ago there was a discussion of rubber  winding on the FFML. I 
<br />
posted a comment about some F1D flyers taking 10  minutes to wind a motor to 
<br />
let the heat dissipate during the process. A very  well known F1B flier 
<br />
told me that was ridiculous.

In F1B, several guys have reported that the Tan rubber  starts getting 
<br />
brittle. It still has the good energy return, but it  tends to break 
<br />
abruptly, which is not so nice if it takes place e.g.  during the flyoff 
<br />
(where you only have a 10 minute window to wind the  motor, pick the air 
<br />
and start your flight). Many people say that they  prefer to use SS, as 
<br />
they can rely on the rubber holding together for  the flight.
<br />
<br /><br />An article covering this phenomenon of breaking in the NFFS '09 Sympo  by 
<br />
Fred Pierce.  Rubber can be pretty complex and Fred explains some of  the 
<br />
interesting features to consider.
<br />
Excerpting some of the article....
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;Rubber undergoes two types of change-of-state when winding and  then 
<br />
relaxing a rubber motor.
<br />
<br />1) Stretching out and winding a rubber motor changes its  molecular order 
<br />
from a mass of randomly oriented tangled polymer chains to a  stretched out 
<br />
untangled more orderly state. It gives up heat, it reduces its  entropy (a 
<br />
thermodynamic measure of the amount of energy available for  useful work), and 
<br />
hence, the energy available is reduced.
<br />
<br />2) Another, and more difficult to comprehend change-of-state  energy loss 
<br />
(gives up heat) is the “crystallization&quot; of the polymer chains.  This is 
<br />
where a molecular crystal is formed following a well-defined  pattern, or 
<br />
structure, dictated by forces acting at the molecular level (see  phase change 
<br />
diagram). The natural rubber component in a blended rubber as  the motor is 
<br />
stretched (strained) by winding, “crystallizes.” The technical  term is “
<br />
Strain Induced Crystallization.”
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
...Heat is a critical issue. One must understand the temperature  behavior 
<br />
of the rubber motor as it is being wound and then how to cope with  it. Most 
<br />
of the “good” rubber produced, say FAI Model Supply May 1999, had a  
<br />
practical upper limit of 80-85 degrees F, where it could rupture. If in  winding, 
<br />
the rubber heated up due to the hysteresis, and if the starting  
<br />
temperature of the rubber was at ambient and the ambient temperature was  high, the 
<br />
rubber could be at a temperature above well above 80 degrees F and  subject to 
<br />
breakage. The example is indoor flying where motors would break  well into 
<br />
the flight. The temperature at the floor was near 70 degrees F and  the 
<br />
temperature at ceiling height could be near 100 degrees F. The motor  would heat 
<br />
up due to the long unwinding time and still be under high stress.  The long 
<br />
motor runs were not sufficient to keep the motor cool enough as it  would 
<br />
absorb heat from the ambient surroundings.
<br />
<br />...A significant feature is that only natural rubber can  crystallize. The 
<br />
synthetic rubber in a blend like FAI Model Supply Super  Sport does not 
<br />
crystallize when being wound, but does slightly when being  held after winding.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
A special note: Experiments have also shown that  the speed at which one 
<br />
performs a stretch or winding can have a significant  affect. The resistance 
<br />
to notch propagation from small nicks in the rubber  is diminished the faster 
<br />
you stretch wind; speed can blow motors.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
...It is possible to lower the motor temperature rise from winding.  It is 
<br />
done as part of the common pre-winding stretch to increase potential  turns. 
<br />
You hold the stretch, say less than a minute, relax it, and pull it  out a 
<br />
second time to wind. The maximum temperature rise encountered by the  motor 
<br />
will be reduced.&quot;
