It's not a long story, so here it is, ungarbled:
<br />
<br /><br />The First Nats Penny Plane Contest Recalled
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />The very first Penny Plane contest at an AMA Nationals was held as an 
<br />
unofficial finale of the 1970 Indoor Nationals in Chicago. The event was 
<br />
sponsored by the Chicago Aeronuts club. Veteran indoor flier and former 
<br />
world FAI indoor champ Erv Rodemsky had conceived the Penny Plane event and 
<br />
acted as CD for this innaugural competition. The site was the Washington 
<br />
Park Armory on the south side of the city. The date was Tuesday, July 28, 
<br />
1970. My son Christopher and I were there, and I still have the results 
<br />
sheet mailed to all 28 participants, including five proxy entries, by the 
<br />
late Pete Sotich on behalf of the Aeronuts.
<br />
<br />The rules used at that first meet resulted in models that were considerably 
<br />
different than those flown under today's rules. They were smaller, looking 
<br />
somewhat like Easy B's covered with standard Japanese tissue. As I recall, 
<br />
the wing was limited to a span of 18 inches, with a chord noticeably less 
<br />
than today's models. As it is today, the minimum weight could be no less 
<br />
than that of a new penny, 3.1 grams. There was no condenser paper or plastic 
<br />
film covering to be seen. There was only one category of model, not the two 
<br />
that we now have, and there were two age categories, one for juniors with 
<br />
nine entries, and an open category for everyone else with 28 fliers. Erv 
<br />
Rodemsky not only CD'd the contest, but also flew in it and made the 
<br />
trophies.
<br />
<br />Junior Penny Plane was won by Tim Noonan, son of the late Jim Noonan, with a 
<br />
very good 6:32 flight. Second went to my son, Christopher, with 3:57. 
<br />
Michael Parykaza was third at 3:26.
<br />
<br />Open was won by Clarence Mather with an 8:28 flight. Second went to Erv 
<br />
Rodemsky at 8:16. Third place was taken by me with 6:48. Below me in the 
<br />
standings were such names as Fudo Takagi, Dave Linstrum, Charlie Sotich, 
<br />
Chuck Markos, and Jim Richmond!
<br />
<br />That contest was informal and fun. The models were easily built and 
<br />
uncomplicated. But by the very next year, 1971, new rules saw the emergence 
<br />
of more sophisticated, larger condenser paper-covered models with the bigger 
<br />
diameter props very similar to what we see in the event today. That contest 
<br />
in Chicago 37 years ago was the first and last time I flew Penny Plane.
