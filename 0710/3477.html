<br />This is not actually a file attachment, but rather a file that has 
<br />
been uuencoded into ascii characters which are included as part of

<br />The First Nats Penny Plane Contest Recalled
<br />
<br /><br />The very first Penny Plane contest at an AMA Nationals was held as an 
<br />
unofficial finale of the 1970 Indoor Nationals in Chicago. The event 
<br />
was sponsored by the Chicago Aeronuts club. Veteran indoor flier and 
<br />
former world FAI indoor champ Erv Rodemsky had conceived the Penny 
<br />
Plane event and acted as CD for this innaugural competition. The site 
<br />
was the Washington Park Armory on the south side of the city. The 
<br />
date was Tuesday, July 28, 1970. My son Christopher and I were there, 
<br />
and I still have the results sheet mailed to all 28 participants, 
<br />
including five proxy entries, by the late Pete Sotich on behalf of 
<br />
the Aeronuts.
<br />
<br />The rules used at that first meet resulted in models that were 
<br />
considerably different than those flown under today's rules. They 
<br />
were smaller, looking somewhat like Easy B's covered with standard 
<br />
Japanese tissue. As I recall, the wing was limited to a span of 18 
<br />
inches, with a chord noticeably less than today's models. As it is 
<br />
today, the minimum weight could be no less than that of a new penny, 
<br />
3.1 grams. There was no condenser paper or plastic film covering to 
<br />
be seen. There was only one category of model, not the two that we 
<br />
now have, and there were two age categories, one for juniors with 
<br />
nine entries, and an open category for everyone else with 28 fliers. 
<br />
Erv Rodemsky not only CD'd the contest, but also flew in it and made 
<br />
the trophies.
<br />
<br />Junior Penny Plane was won by Tim Noonan, son of the late Jim Noonan, 
<br />
with a very good 6:32 flight. Second went to my son, Christopher, 
<br />
with 3:57. Michael Parykaza was third at 3:26.
<br />
<br />Open was won by Clarence Mather with an 8:28 flight. Second went to 
<br />
Erv Rodemsky at 8:16. Third place was taken by me with 6:48. Below me 
<br />
in the standings were such names as Fudo Takagi, Dave Linstrum, 
<br />
Charlie Sotich, Chuck Markos, and Jim Richmond!
<br />
<br />That contest was informal and fun. The models were easily built and 
<br />
uncomplicated. But by the very next year, 1971, new rules saw the 
<br />
emergence of more sophisticated, larger condenser paper-covered 
<br />
models with the bigger diameter props very similar to what we see in 
<br />
the event today. That contest in Chicago 37 years ago was the first 
<br />
and last time I flew Penny Plane.
