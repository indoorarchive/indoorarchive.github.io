Hi All,
<br />
<br />As you know there has been a problem, at least some think so, with the 2008 rules in 
<br />
regard as to what is the definition of &quot;opaque&quot; and &quot;vertical&quot;. Since I will be presenting 4 
<br />
hours of workshops at the National Coaches Conference in San Francisco this weekend, I 
<br />
needed an answer quickly. I felt that most people, if they looked at the rules, would 
<br />
(should) ask about this.
<br />
<br />Anyway, today I reached people at the S.O. headquarters on the phone and asked about 
<br />
this, explaining why I had to find out something quickly. I was told that the new rule arose 
<br />
after several models had to be flown at once at some meets, especially at the Nationals 
<br />
last year, because of the large number of entrants and not enough time blocks available. 
<br />
The rule is an attempt to identify different models in the air at the same time.
<br />
<br />I was refered to a person, (a very qualified one, not at headquarters), who is on the 
<br />
committee that formulates the model airplane rules and he agreed that there is a problem. 
<br />
As we discussed the situation, this is what he came up with and he said that they (the 
<br />
committee) will be finalizing a clarification very soon and posting it on the S.O.    
<br />
clarifications page (soinc.org).
<br />
<br />Here it is - Opaque will mean colored tissue paper will be O.K. Felt tip pens used on mylar 
<br />
will not be O.K. as this can be very translucent and/or faint. He agreed that many designs 
<br />
don't use vertical surfaces, only angled tips for stability. Therefore, vertical is to mean not 
<br />
horizontal and having no vertical rudder (fin) will be O.K. Colored, angled tips will do fine 
<br />
as the idea is identification.
<br />
<br />This, or a similar version, will appear soon on the S.O. clarifications page. btw, the person 
<br />
refered to above is on this net, at least as a lurker.
<br />
