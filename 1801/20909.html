Greetings.
<br />
So I am not privy to the rationale behind either one of these two rules proposals.
<br />
Any rules change should be made to rectify a problem with the existing rules. 
<br />
<br />For #1, I don't understand the problem. If a model that meets two sets of rules is flown and breaks a record in those two events, then the record is broken in both events. I don't see any harm in this, so it doesn't make much sense to me why this proposal even exists. 
<br />
<br />For #2, the proposal as written will take a sledgehammer to the indoor events. An easy loophole would be to have ten people just sign up for every event each year and keep all the events as is. 
<br />
<br />If I have to guess the rationale behind proposal #2, it would be that indoor has too many events and too few participants and this popularity contest is a way to cull that number of events down.
<br />
Let's say that I even agree with this assessment: that we need to cull the number of events in Indoor.The real question then is: Is this the right way to go about it?
<br />
To answer that question, I would say No. 
<br />
<br />Careful consideration and extensive consultation with the existing indoor fliers is what is needed.Local clubs fly events that appeal to them, however not all local fliers attend the NATS. 
<br />
Why this is would be a discussion for another day. But the lack of fliers at the national contest determining what can be flown locally is sort of backwards.
<br />
Either way, I would urge the contest board to vote NO on both proposals.At the same time, I would urge them to figure out how to:1) Increase participation at the NATS, and to
<br />
2) Begin consultation with local clubs to see if culling any indoor events makes sense. 
<br />
<br />Regards.Mike Kirda

<br />&nbsp;Dear Indoor Community,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;I want to point out to the indoor community two AMA general rule proposals that will have a direct effect AMA indoor records and AMA Indoor events.
<br />
&nbsp;Both proposals are listed here. 
<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.modelaircraft.org/events/ruleproposals/indoorff.aspx">http://www.modelaircraft.org/events/ruleproposals/indoorff.aspx</a>
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;These are listed under Indoor as they are changes to the AMA general rules which apply to all models so Indoor is included.  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;IFF 19-01
<br />
&nbsp;This will eliminate allowing one flight to set two national records at one time. As a Junior I set records with one flight with a model fitting two classes, such as EZB and Int Stick, 65cm F1D and Hand Launch Stick. This practice would no longer be allowed. Only one class record could be flown for at a time. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;IFF 19-02
<br />
&nbsp;This will take AMA events that do not received 10 entries at the Indoor Nats during a 2 year rules cycle and reduce those events from official AMA events to AMA &quot;provisional&quot; status which means national records are no longer kept. After two more years, if still below 10 entries then the event is deleted from the rule book. 
<br />
&nbsp; 
<br />
&nbsp;I feel these are important proposals that must be reviewed by the Indoor community before the March 15, 2018 rules proposal deadline. . 
<br />
&nbsp;- 
<br />
&nbsp;Don Slusarczyk
<br />
&nbsp;Indoor Contest Board Chairman
