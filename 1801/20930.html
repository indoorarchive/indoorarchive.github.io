Harking back to the early 60's, There were six main indoor classes: AROG, B, C and D stick and B and C cabin.  Helicopter and Autogyro plus ROW were also there but very seldom flown.  FAI stick was really  a subset of D and Wally Miller had just come up with easy B which was being flown locally in SoCal.  The Nats just flew Stick and Cabin but those of us who were active really competed against the records.  A group spearheaded by Bud Tenney decided that there were too many classes and lobbied AMA to cut down the number.  The only reason they really came up  with was that it took too much effort by HQ to keep up with all the records.  At that time, Frank Ehling was Technical Director and he assured me that it really wasn't any trouble at all.  Anyway they won and a bunch of classes were eliminated.  Here we are again almost 50 years later and the situation sounds awfully similar.  Leave the less popular classes in for those who want to compete against the record.
