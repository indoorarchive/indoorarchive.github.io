Tom, thank you for the historical perspective.  I haven’t been playing this game nearly long enough to have been part of those days, so take my comments for what they are worth.
<br />
<br />At the contests I have attended, it seems like most people usually end up flying against a record, whether it be national, a site record, or even a personal best.  F1D might be the exception to that, as I have witnessed some pretty great competitive F1D flying.
<br />
<br />I can’t speak for everyone else here, but I don’t think anyone is saying we have to fly all of the established events at every contest.  Rather the idea is that if this rule proposal is adopted into the books, the records for the vast majority of events will no longer be kept.  The way I interpret the situation is then there would be no more records for those events, and thus flyers would have nothing to fly against, and those events would be effectively dead.
<br />
<br />If we want to keep flying for records in events such as AROG, EZB, A6, Autogiro, IHLS, Manhattan Cabin, Ornithopter, etc, we should not accept any rule that discards them from the record books.
<br />
<br />That said, I definitely don’t support this rule change, and doubt many other AMA flyers would either, as it affects ALL aspects of aero modeling that are sanctioned by AMA.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Harking back to the early 60's, There were six main indoor classes: AROG, B, C and D stick and B and C cabin.  Helicopter and Autogyro plus ROW were also there but very seldom flown.  FAI stick was really  a subset of D and Wally Miller had just come up with easy B which was being flown locally in SoCal.  The Nats just flew Stick and Cabin but those of us who were active really competed against the records.  A group spearheaded by Bud Tenney decided that there were too many classes and lobbied AMA to cut down the number.  The only reason they really came up  with was that it took too much effort by HQ to keep up with all the records.  At that time, Frank Ehling was Technical Director and he assured me that it really wasn't any trouble at all.  Anyway they won and a bunch of classes were eliminated.  Here we are again almost 50 years later and the situation sounds awfully similar.  Leave the less popular classes in for those who want to compete against the record.
