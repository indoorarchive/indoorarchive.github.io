I would think that in the long run, multiple records set with the same model regardless of weather or not it is with the same flight(s) would be eclipsed by models designed specifically for each event. It might take awhile but I believe this would happen. So, what is the issue?
<br />
<br />It would also seem to me this is the that are too many (similar) events. So why not eliminate similar events? Having said this, I am pretty sure the proposal on the table is NOT the way to do it. A better way to eliminate events? I don't know of a solution that would be agreeable to everyone.
<br />
<br />In summary, my opinions are:
<br />
- allow a single flight or series of flights (if the rules dictate) to set records in whatever events the model and flights qualify. Status quo
<br />
- reduce the number of events, but NOT by the proposed method. Again, i don't have a suggestion that would be agreeable to everyone, so I would look to our leaders to make some tough decisions for the long term good of our sport.

<br />Setting multiple records with one attempt is common in other sports.  In track and field, one can set  both the 200m and 400m running sprint record in one race (yes, it has been done in the past).  In full size airplanes, the time to altitude and highest altitude have been set with the same flight.
<br />
<br /><br />I have always thought that any Cat II record longer than the current Cat III record should also count as a Cat II record for purely logical reason.
<br />
<br />Setting records is one big reason many people fly.  Often fliers will tell me that they do not want to attend a contest because the site is much lower than the highest allowable for a height category.  Amassing record has been a goal for many and taking away the ability to set multiple records at the same just puts more obstacles in the way of our sport and can only lessen participation.
<br />
<br />BTW, some of the reasoning given in the rule proposal is not sound.  Although a flight flown in the a contest can only count for the event standings in the event flown, many of our contests also include record trials.  It is in such record trials that many of the multiple records are set.
<br />
<br />And, a record really stands for the best flight ever in a class and height category.  Should we really care that only one class can apply?  Finally, for record flights , luck and conditions are always a factor but the much greater factor is the model and the flying and building skills of the pilot.  Such a pilot should get all the records and accolades deserved and available.
