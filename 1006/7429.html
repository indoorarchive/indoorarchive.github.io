Bill, That is and has been a rule since I've been going to USIC.
<br />
<br />I think there are several things to consider here. First, I was yelled at
<br />
twice during the contest from across the dome for getting close to models
<br />
that were more than 100ft away. The owners of these models failed to
<br />
recognize that it impossible to just depth across large expanse of the
<br />
floor. I've watched many experienced flyers walk out and check where their
<br />
model is before saying something. I've also seen a number of people new to
<br />
the hobby do the opposite of that. Secondly, Every time, at any contest, I
<br />
go out to retrieve or steer a model I do so with the perception that If
<br />
touch anther model with my balloon I will be disqualified. I normally
<br />
request a spotter to make sure I don't have a problem. So with that said, I
<br />
don't think that it is fair to complain about someone retrieving in the
<br />
flying area. If they touch your model, take a reflight and comfort yourself
<br />
with notion that you are competing against one less person. If the model
<br />
will do a winning time, it will normally do it with some consistency. As a
<br />
side note, half the retrievals I attempted this year were for other people.
<br />
Kagan retrieved countless models for other people this year. I think in this
<br />
case we should add anther thank you the list of thank yous Kagan is owed for
<br />
this years USIC. I don't think it is realistic to say that the maybe five
<br />
people set up to do retrievals at USIC should be limited to getting their
<br />
plans and everyone else down with in a 30min window once a day. Which some
<br />
days wasn't even given. I personally always yielded to flights as a was
<br />
retrieving, and think when asked nicely everyone will do the same. Third,
<br />
illegal steering is just that. The FAI rules clearly define what one may or
<br />
may not do. It is up to the person witnessing the illegal steer to report
<br />
it. If we all ignore it, then we have nothing to complain about. I've never
<br />
heard of a CD, not addressing the issue when it is brought to their
<br />
attention. 4th Flying out of time slot at USIC is also outlined in the blue
<br />
USIC rules document. We are supposed to use the two basketball courts for
<br />
test flying. However, as attendance has declined, we have taken to flying
<br />
out the edges of the dome. As a lightweight flyer I don't take issue with
<br />
this as long as models are kept under control and the people flying out of
<br />
time slot do not mind steering or have their models steered when a flight
<br />
with right-of-way wonders over.
<br />
<br />Nick
