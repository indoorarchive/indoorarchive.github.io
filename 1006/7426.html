<br />
I should speak up here also. I was one of the people who was retrieving
<br />
models during the contest. I, along with John, not only retrieved our own
<br />
models, but successfully retrieved the models of many other competitors. On
<br />
only one occasion, I accidentally snagged Kang's LPP. I apologized and made
<br />
sure the model was okay. While I was retrieving, I had two spotters to help
<br />
me watch out for other peoples planes. Most of the day Sunday was spent
<br />
retrieving my Pro AM partner's LPP. There were many &quot;Sportsman&quot; LPPs hung up
<br />
that day, as to be expected.
<br />
<br />As far as the retrieval period is concerned, I think it is next to useless.
<br />
The top competitors will launch their flights right up to the very end of
<br />
the flying session, and with that, there are still models in the air during
<br />
retrieval periods.
<br />
<br />As I have come to know, the art of retrieving a plane from the girders at
<br />
USIC takes a slow and steady hand, and is not something that can be rushed.
<br />
I waited patiently for other planes to clear the airspace under my line
<br />
before even deciding to have a go at it with the balloon. Such is the nature
<br />
of USIC that there are many planes in the air at any given time. I did my
<br />
best to respect others flights. Unless there is some sort of &quot;no retrieving&quot;
<br />
rule imposed then there will not be a solution to this situation. I think
<br />
the best outcome will be from good communication between competitors.
<br />
<br />On the issue of balloons, I think the more pressing problem I witnessed, on
<br />
many occasions at USIC, was improper steering. I saw someone add altitude to
<br />
the flight of a plane with a balloon, and also steer the plane only to
<br />
center it in the space. The &quot;centering&quot; steer I find to be particularly
<br />
problematic when the flight is still at a low  altitude and is no where near
<br />
any of the building structure. It is okay to steer away from the scoreboard
<br />
cables, or the speakers, or even another plane, but I think it is not
<br />
acceptable to position your plane in the center of the building when it is
<br />
not in danger of hitting anything. Also, the &quot;centering&quot; steer is more
<br />
likely to interfere with other planes because it places the balloon in the
<br />
prime airspace.
