I never contribute but I feel the need to chime in at this time.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I think we all need to chill out. The only time I get upset about &quot;heavier
<br />
classes&quot; flying is when some dude is out on the middle of the floor throwing
<br />
a hand launch glider 20 minutes into the F1D time slot, or when a Coconut is
<br />
flying an unpredictable pattern at 45mph-both happened at this year's usic.
<br />
Otherwise, come on people-there is no way an experienced guy like Bill Gowen
<br />
will let his F1L test flights get out of hand to the point where it 'tears'
<br />
through an F1D wing.  I'm not going to get upset about Nick Ray flying his
<br />
Ministick or spending 2 days lying on the floor trying to get it out of the
<br />
ceiling. Just don't do it during the last 10 minutes of the LPP barnburner,
<br />
at the center of the floor, because getting your model back at that time
<br />
probably won't make a difference. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Let's not be at each other's throats. Because if we can't live together, we
<br />
will all die alone.

<br />
<br />Bill, That is and has been a rule since I've been going to USIC. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I think there are several things to consider here. First, I was yelled at
<br />
twice during the contest from across the dome for getting close to models
<br />
that were more than 100ft away. The owners of these models failed to
<br />
recognize that it impossible to just depth across large expanse of the
<br />
floor. I've watched many experienced flyers walk out and check where their
<br />
model is before saying something. I've also seen a number of people new to
<br />
the hobby do the opposite of that. Secondly, Every time, at any contest, I
<br />
go out to retrieve or steer a model I do so with the perception that If
<br />
touch anther model with my balloon I will be disqualified. I normally
<br />
request a spotter to make sure I don't have a problem. So with that said, I
<br />
don't think that it is fair to complain about someone retrieving in the
<br />
flying area. If they touch your model, take a reflight and comfort yourself
<br />
with notion that you are competing against one less person. If the model
<br />
will do a winning time, it will normally do it with some consistency. As a
<br />
side note, half the retrievals I attempted this year were for other people.
<br />
Kagan retrieved countless models for other people this year. I think in this
<br />
case we should add anther thank you the list of thank yous Kagan is owed for
<br />
this years USIC. I don't think it is realistic to say that the maybe five
<br />
people set up to do retrievals at USIC should be limited to getting their
<br />
plans and everyone else down with in a 30min window once a day. Which some
<br />
days wasn't even given. I personally always yielded to flights as a was
<br />
retrieving, and think when asked nicely everyone will do the same. Third,
<br />
illegal steering is just that. The FAI rules clearly define what one may or
<br />
may not do. It is up to the person witnessing the illegal steer to report
<br />
it. If we all ignore it, then we have nothing to complain about. I've never
<br />
heard of a CD, not addressing the issue when it is brought to their
<br />
attention. 4th Flying out of time slot at USIC is also outlined in the blue
<br />
USIC rules document. We are supposed to use the two basketball courts for
<br />
test flying. However, as attendance has declined, we have taken to flying
<br />
out the edges of the dome. As a lightweight flyer I don't take issue with
<br />
this as long as models are kept under control and the people flying out of
<br />
time slot do not mind steering or have their models steered when a flight
<br />
with right-of-way wonders over. 
<br />

<br />You are correct that the rule is not stated in this year's USIC info. I
<br />
don't have any previous info sheets to see if it was ever a written rule. I
<br />
just know that in my early years at USIC I was forcefully told that if I
<br />
touched another person's model in flight I would be disqualified from that
<br />
event. I assumed that was still the rule.

When did this &quot;rule&quot; go into effect? The steering rules clearly state 
<br />
what is to happen:
<br />
<br />&quot;If other models are fouled by the steerer, the fouled competitor has 
<br />
the choice of a substitute flight, which, if taken, is his score for 
<br />
that round. He must exercise this choice to his timekeepers not later 
<br />
than two (2) minutes after termination of his flight. If he chooses to 
<br />
restart, he must do so before his next official flight&quot;
