To all...This is from the Sympo and talks F1B motors, but the physics is  
<br />
the same, various batches which are VERY temperature sensitive relative to 
<br />
the  ratio of natural versus synthetic rubbers in the blend.  Fred mentioned a 
<br />
&nbsp;certain batch exploding in flight at an indoor contest...the temp at 
<br />
flight  altitude in a high temp gradient facility was above the practical temp 
<br />
limit for  the batch, anyway...here are some excerpts regarding the 
<br />
thermodynamics:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;To  begin, the energy available to a rubber motor is less than the input 
<br />
of winding  a rubber motor.  A physics term,  Hysteresis is the lag of effect 
<br />
when forces acting on a rubber motor are  changed.  For a rubber motor, 
<br />
there  is a loss of input energy due to hysteresis, called the “hysteresis heat.
<br />
” This  hysteresis heat is a complex matter. It consists of friction losses 
<br />
between the  strands and that internal to the strands. A well-lubricated 
<br />
motor has relatively  little friction losses. Almost all the energy lost is 
<br />
due to “change-of-state”  loss. An example is that of water freezing and then 
<br />
melting. The phase changes  are first giving up heat to freeze, and 
<br />
requiring the same amount of heat to  melt. The laws of physics dictate that ice, 
<br />
having a more ordered crystalline  molecular state than water with its random 
<br />
molecules, must give up heat and  regain the same amount of heat to  melt. 
<br />
..... 
<br />
Temperature  changes encountered during winding and any pre-winding stretch 
<br />
to increase turns  can be surprisingly large.  Without  a pre-winding 
<br />
stretch the motor temperature will rise 25 degrees F (13.9 deg C)  above ambient. 
<br />
...... 
<br />
The pre-winding stretch, hold and relax procedure before winding  is really 
<br />
a mini break-in procedure.  It enables the motor to take more turns because 
<br />
it is temporarily longer  when relaxed.  The phenomenon is  caused by very 
<br />
short term slippage between polymer chains.  The technical term is plastic 
<br />
flow.  In a full break-in procedure the  immediate measurement of the relaxed 
<br />
motor indicates an approximate 8% increase  in length which overnight 
<br />
typically declines to a permanent set of about  3.5%.  An estimate of the 
<br />
transient  elongation of the motor from a pre-wind stretch is about 3%.  If without 
<br />
the procedure you expected  400 turns, you now get 12 more turns.  This is 
<br />
a major boost. 
<br />
..... 
<br />
Remember, the old child’s trick of stretching a  rubber band or strip of 
<br />
rubber and touching it to your lips?  It will be distinctly warm.  Pull it 
<br />
away and relax it and again  touch it to your lips.  It will be  cold.  This 
<br />
effect can be used  during a pre-winding stretch to cool the motor in hot 
<br />
weather.  It might be called  “auto-refrigeration.” 
<br />
...... 
<br />
In  stretch testing of rubber, the liberation of heat has a significant 
<br />
effect on  the results.  A quick testing  procedure, especially during the high 
<br />
pull force period does not give the heat  of hysteresis time to dissipate 
<br />
to the atmosphere.  Thus, you can measure a higher  relaxation energy that if 
<br />
you were using a slower paced technique.  Since the instantaneous rise in  
<br />
temperature from the heat of hysteresis might be over 20 deg F (11 deg C).  
<br />
The quick test might give as much as 10%  more relaxation energy than a slow 
<br />
&nbsp;test. 
<br />
When [an F1B Motor] stretched to about 40  pounds (18.2  Kg) the motors’  
<br />
temperature rises about 8 degrees F (5 deg C) above the  ambient.  The rise 
<br />
in temperature is  from the hysteresis of the change of state taking place.  
<br />
If held at the stretch for about a  minute, all this heat will be dissipated 
<br />
to the atmosphere.  Then when relaxed, the motor will drop  its temperature 
<br />
8 degrees F ( 5 deg C) below ambient to reverse the change of  state.  So, 
<br />
when you stretch to  begin winding you start out 8 degrees F (5 deg C) 
<br />
cooler.  This might save blowing the motor in hot  weather.  But, on a cold day 
<br />
you  don’t want the to cool the motor.  You avoid this by not relaxing after 
<br />
the hold period.  You just begin  winding. 
<br />
During the holding period whole looking for good air the addition  of 
<br />
hand-cranked turns does not add any appreciable hysteresis heat.  This is because 
<br />
all the possible  crystallization of the natural rubber polymer chains has 
<br />
already taken  place.  And, all the significant  change of state from 
<br />
stretching out the tangled and balled up polymer chains  toward a more orderly 
<br />
state has taken place.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
FYI.....summary...it's  the mechanical forces on the rubber that induce 
<br />
phase changes in the polymers  and the particular batches vary in thermodynamic 
<br />
response.  It's OK though  because if you sacrifice a few motors, you can 
<br />
get the best method of getting  maximum performance out of a given 
<br />
batch....test...test...test...

<br />The ideal is to have your rubber at  30 to 35C. So warm it up or cool it 
<br />
down to get to that. If you cannot,  select a batch that can stand the 
<br />
heat, or giver better torque in the  cold.
<br />
<br />I think that at indoor motor dimensions all heat produced by  winding is 
<br />
dissipated at once to the surrounding  air.
