Nick,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the most part, I agree with your assessment, however there are a couple points which represent probable logical inconsistencies.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;1. It is extremely rare for anyone to master F1D in under 4 years. Sure, I did it, but only with regards to Cat I F1D. That was because I a location to fly 4-5 days a week. I still stink at anything higher than Cat I. Also, I only know of two people who have demonstrated a rapid rise to W/C level--Kang and Jim Richmond. Both are exceptional fliers in every possible way. I suspect that there is someone out there who mastered F1 racing in that length of time. It is theoretically possible for an exceptional talent. The other 99.99% just aren't going to achieve that no matter how hard they try.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;2. You also mention the need for F1D to be the F1 of indoor. I don't want to go too far down this road, but if F1D is to represent that, it should be essentially a no-holds-barred event in which things can indeed be bought. I'd further note that F1 isn't a really good comparison. It is a highly politicized event which operates as much on making money through public attention as anything else. F1 also goes into banning specific materials and parts (such as boron structures) in order to prevent prohibitive costs. I find that ironic considering that F1's cost is indeed prohibitive anyway.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Having seen the tremendous cost required to produce Treger hubs and the fact that carbon blades are not exactly something a lot of folks can do (my wife, understanding though she is, certainly wouldn't let me make epoxy molded parts in our apartment) because of variables they can't control, such as their living situation. The difficulty level isn't nearly so much the issue as the fact that a lot of folks cannot afford the tooling or the workspace to build competitive airplanes. I fear that the new 1.4 g rules are going to make this problem much, much worse, especially considering that there were already models appearing which had no wood forward of the tailboom plug other than the wing itself.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Indoor is definitely in dire need of more and better publicity. I am personally working on some projects to hopefully improve this situation and am excited about the possibility of two of those efforts coming to fruition this year.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Indoor flying sites are definitely a major problem. We've had a couple years now in which USIC is a questionable item, and at a time when there has otherwise been a lot of opportunity for getting new folks into the indoor disciplines.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;There really needs to be a national indoor flying site here in the US. Given the number of indoor R/C meets across the country, I think some strategic partnering provide the necessary push to get a site built in Muncie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;I for one am contemplating building my own Cat I site sometime in the next few years. We're blessed with cheap land here in Middle Georgia, and I'm blessed with the building experience necessary to reduce a lot of the costs. And my wife is very understanding.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
