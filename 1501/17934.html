The topic of purchased parts seems to be fraught with opinions based on an
<br />
incomplete understanding of the relevant facts. Leo's argument isn't guilty
<br />
of &quot;generalizing from the specific.&quot; Leo is correct in stating that parts
<br />
are currently being purchased or given, and then being used in
<br />
competitions. Naming individuals involved only serves obfuscate the larger
<br />
issue at hand. His argument is based on F1D, the highest level of our
<br />
hobby. If a new person can master this class in 4 years time, then it is
<br />
perhaps too easy. A Formula 1 driver would be hard pressed to qualify for a
<br />
FIA Super License with only 4 years of driving experience, let alone win a
<br />
Formula 1 Championship. F1D is supposed to be the Formula 1 of indoor
<br />
flying.
<br />
<br />There have been several attempts in the US to provide potential flyers with
<br />
planes and competitions to fly them in. To my knowledge, none of the flyers
<br />
in those programs have continued flying past the one year mark.
<br />
<br />I am all for creating competitions for models made with purchased
<br />
components to boost participation. I don't think that F1D is the place to
<br />
do it though. Catering to participants at the world championship level that
<br />
do not have &quot;mechanical skills- or desire- or time&quot; will not ultimately
<br />
increase participation at the world champions because these participants
<br />
don't have the time or desire to take a week off and travel to the world
<br />
championships even if the planes waiting for them there when they arrive.
<br />
<br />Increasing participation at the world championship level has more to due
<br />
with deceasing the other barriers to entry: deceasing the cost of
<br />
attendance through sponsorship, decreasing the cost of the models by
<br />
barring purchased parts, and locating the world championships in desirable
<br />
locations where contestants are comfortable bringing their families. The
<br />
latter is especially important for juniors because their parents have to
<br />
consent to them attending the world championships.
<br />
<br />Increasing participation broadly can be accomplished best through local
<br />
clubs. New modelers are not going to spend the thousands of dollars
<br />
required to attend a world champions. However, they might spend a
<br />
Saturday afternoon at a local event, and that is where purchased components
<br />
should be allowed, if so desired by new flyers. As the participants
<br />
progress, the restrictions, and perhaps the cost in the form of required
<br />
tools and materials, should increase. This process is somewhat analogous to
<br />
the psychology behind American fraternity and sorority recruitment. These
<br />
organizations throw a party and make participation appear fun and
<br />
rewarding. They then increase the work required to stay, so that leaving
<br />
means either the work one has done so far wasn't hard or they have wasted
<br />
their efforts thus far. That's the psychological recipe for life long
<br />
membership retention. Removing the final hurdle(s) to mastery of our hobby
<br />
will only ultimately serve to shorten the length of time participants stay
<br />
engaged. The majority of current indoor flyers were around for the 65cm F1D
<br />
rules, back when it was really hard, the 55cm rules have produced
<br />
proportionally fewer lifers, and I suspect that 55cm 1.4g will produce
<br />
fewer yet still. I fear what will happen if we make it even easier. Rather
<br />
than changing the rules, lets focus on flying regularly, so that
<br />
more people are exposed to our hobby, while simultaneously nurturing those
<br />
who show interest. That way there will still be a goal for them to
<br />
reach toward after several years of participation.
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Nick Ray

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; “Some say it is too hard and takes too long to master the sport. I say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that such arguments are incorrect. The current Open World Champion flew his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first AMA events (F1L and LPP) almost exactly four years before winning the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; WC last April. The current Junior WC flew built and flew his first plane
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Science Olympiad) only just more than two years before winning the WC.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Both are skilled and hard working competitors but what both did in such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; short relative times belay any argument that the sport is too hard and

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; takes too long to master.”

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I haven’t flown indoor duration events for many years, but I can recognize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a basic fault in reasoning when I see it, namely the all-too familiar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pitfall of generalizing from the specific. In this case it’s examples of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two individuals’ rapid success being extrapolated into a specious premise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that therefore everyone else flying competition indoor should be able to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same. In the real indoor world of varying skill levels of model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; construction and flying, it simply doesn’t work like that. Being a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successful indoor flier doesn’t necessarily give you the mechanical skills-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or desire- or time- to build intricate propeller hubs. Each of us modelers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has his or her limits, our strengths and weaknesses. These can vary widely.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Having witnessed the indoor scene, both as competitor and photographer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; over the past 69 years that have passed since since my first astounding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; viewing of indoor flying at the Wichita Nationals in 1946, I believe we may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well be witnessing the gradually increasing twilight of classic indoor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flying. Anything within reason that can be done to prolong that twilight,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps bring back the daylight, should be welcomed and encouraged. That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should certainly include the opportunity to legally purchase and use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pre-built prop hubs.
