Don, 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;For some reason your recent post is not viewable on my system (I read the webpage rather than getting email) but I could read it by viewing the source.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I never said anyone flew in competition with purchased parts other than vp hubs.  Kang has used a Treger vp hub in the past year.  I witnessed flights that I think were official with the hub and others,including one cd, have told me the same.  I recall Kang also telling me he did so but my memory may be faulty with age.  If Kang did not fly official flights with the Treger hub, I apologize to him.  Most, if not all, of the British fliers at Kibbie in 2013 flew Treger hubs in their official F1D flights.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Mark Bennett has publicly put up complete F1D's for sale.  I recall reading it on this forum or, perhaps, HipPocket.  Larry Coslick has given one of his away to an F1D beginner who planned to learn to fly an F1D with it (I witnessed that transaction and helped pack the plane).   Mike Kirda has mentioned possibly having carbon composite prop and wing tip outlines for sale, if I recall correctly.  I understand that Ivan Treger is making carbon composite prop outlines and I suspect they will be for sale just as are his vp hubs.  However, I have never said that I knew of any of these parts being flown officially in contests by other than the builder.  Carbon composite F1D motor sticks have been offered for sale, too.  Finally, I have been offered a F1D wing for sale or trade (I thought about flying a wing and stab that were obviously not mine just to tweak some noses).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;As I have said many times, having parts/assemblies for sale is not the same as the parts be used in competition.  I do know of beginning F1D fliers using borrowed parts (vp hubs and props) for non-official flights by more than one flier.  Kang at the 2012 Kibbie Dome annual comes to mind right now and there was one such flier at the 2013 Nats (Urbana) who practiced F1D with a borrowed vp hub.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;In my opinion, it is only a matter of time before purchased parts/assemblies other than vp hubs are used in competition in the US.  I cannot speak for their use elsewhere in the world.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Respectfully,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;LeoP
