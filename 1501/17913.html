TTOMA had a New Years record trials yesterday in recognition of the new F1D rules and AMA recognition of F1R. I used an old hub on my F1R (that's what happens when you sell all your good hubs!) to establish the new record at 19:22 on one of the more stressful flights I've endured. The model first touched the ceiling at the very peak of St. Luke's (somewhere around 33' I think--requires an extremely tight circle of about 10' diameter) around 5 minutes in and continued to smack the rafters and water sprinklers until 14 minutes. I've got to reserve one of the hubs from the production line for myself--they're easier to use. The one I was using had about a 1/4 turn difference between landing with the prop halfway between high and low pitch and hitting low pitch so prematurely that the climb power was expended at 13 minutes.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Nick Ray and I shot it out in F1D. I think his best time was a little over 18 minutes (yes, it was COLD in there). After repeated tweaking, I got off a 19:22 (yes, exactly the same as the F1R flight!) that only hit the ceiling a couple times between 12:00 and 13:30. I think it could be tweaked to get a tiny bit more performance, but it was pretty close to maximum efficiency. The first climb came within 6&quot; of the ceiling, and it only lost 8' altitude before climbing away the second time. All in all a very pretty flight.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Nick put up two very impressive ministick flights just shy of 9 minutes. I thought sure he was going to put up a 9:30 on his last flight, but it started coming down really fast a little after the 8 minute mark.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Bill put up some nice flights in A-6. I don't know how long they were, but they looked nicer than anything I could do for sure!
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Hope put up a massive 2:15 in Phantom Flash with her newest one. Very, very impressive flying. I tried to catch her but finally gave up after various mishaps.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Just finished all my paperwork and just have to update the F1D plan and print stuff out. I assume the plans will appear on INAV in short order.
<br />
