There has been some talk of reducing the number of days for the Kibbie contest in order to have more participants.  The first of the two arguments has been that a reduction in the number of days will reduce the cost and, thus, the entry fee.  Secondly, many people have trouble making five days plus travel time available. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;The second argument can be countered with the realization that fliers do not need to stay for the whole event.  The first argument is a bit more complicated.  There are fixed costs associated with the event that are independent of the number of days for the event.  In my preparation of a draft bid for the 2016 World championships at the Kibbie Dome, these fixed site costs (not including fixed costs for the WC itself) were an amount equal to about about half of the total rental cost (or about one third of the site cost).  These numbers were taken from the past and current costs for the Kibbie annual event as well as the negotiated costs for the WC days (btw, the bid was able to reduce the bid cost by sharing these fixed costs with the annual event to be held immediately prior to the WC event).  What also came out during the discussions with UI to assemble a bid was that the actual rental daily rate cost depended on the number of days of the rental.  There are fixed costs to UI, too, that are included in the daily rental rate.  Thus, reducing the number of days for a future contest will most probably cause the daily rental rate to increase.  That and the fixed costs may yield just a very small, disproportionate, decrease in the entry fee and may result in no decrease in the entry fee.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I also think that decreasing the number of days for the event may also decrease the number of participants.  This decrease in the number of participants is the real problem for our indoor events.  Fliers also have fixed cost for attending a contest and  the major such cost is the cost of traveling to the site and the days lost to travel.  A cost that may seem reasonable for a five day event may seem unreasonable for a two three or three or four day event.  I have attended every Kibbie contest since 2008.  A shorter contest may not justify for me (and others) the travel cost in both time and money.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Finally, I find the five day Kibbie contest a great break time for myself.  It is the most enjoyable contest of the year for me (and even more so in those years when there is no pressure from a concurrent team selection finals or Nats). Thus, I would like to urge that the Kibbie contest be kept to five days and not be shortened.

&nbsp;Ben,

&nbsp;I would strongly encourage you to post this as an update on the Kickstarter.  Many contributors are not on this forum, and they would love to hear an update.

&nbsp;&quot;Float was floated as a Kickstarter campaign without some of the experience to know what would be required. The guys who've been working on it have not stopped. They just realize that it's going to take longer than they thought, the subject gets deeper the more they get into it and that it costs a lot more than they expected it would. Many film projects on Kickstarter have had similar lives and repeat campaigns have aided in keeping up the work to make the film. They seem to be reluctant to ask for more money and have been scraping along enough to slowly add to the body of work they're assembling.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;This is the best assessment of the state of Float that has been written on this Forum. And yes Mike, I am still here. I have been inactive, and as is true for many indoor folks, time and life ebb and flow and for the past year or so I have been out of touch with indoor.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;We have been working, and continue to work, in between supporting ourselves with our main form of income generation (jobs)
<br />
&nbsp;We are currently planning the final rounds of interviews to fill in &quot;holes&quot; in the story. These will take place this spring. 
<br />
&nbsp;When we started the project, I had no clue how to make a movie, and was naive to the amount of work involved. With over 5 years of time invested, not to mention more money from our own pockets than from the Kickstarter campaigns, Phil and I have vowed to not release the film before it is finished, fully.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;The amount of footage, interviews, and images which have been assembled, catalogued, and transcribed, will be a great future resource to the hobby.
