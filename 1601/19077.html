&quot;Float was floated as a Kickstarter campaign without some of the experience
<br />
to know what would be required. The guys who've been working on it have not
<br />
stopped. They just realize that it's going to take longer than they
<br />
thought, the subject gets deeper the more they get into it and that it
<br />
costs a lot more than they expected it would. Many film projects on
<br />
Kickstarter have had similar lives and repeat campaigns have aided in
<br />
keeping up the work to make the film. They seem to be reluctant to ask for
<br />
more money and have been scraping along enough to slowly add to the body of
<br />
work they're assembling.&quot;
<br />
<br />This is the best assessment of the state of Float that has been written on
<br />
this Forum. And yes Mike, I am still here. I have been inactive, and as is
<br />
true for many indoor folks, time and life ebb and flow and for the past
<br />
year or so I have been out of touch with indoor.
<br />
<br />We have been working, and continue to work, in between supporting ourselves
<br />
with our main form of income generation (jobs)
<br />
We are currently planning the final rounds of interviews to fill in &quot;holes&quot;
<br />
in the story. These will take place this spring.
<br />
When we started the project, I had no clue how to make a movie, and was
<br />
naive to the amount of work involved. With over 5 years of time invested,
<br />
not to mention more money from our own pockets than from the Kickstarter
<br />
campaigns, Phil and I have vowed to not release the film before it is
<br />
finished, fully.
<br />
<br />The amount of footage, interviews, and images which have been assembled,
<br />
catalogued, and transcribed, will be a great future resource to the hobby.
