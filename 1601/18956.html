<br />
2. Don&amp;#39;t choose this - I just needed a second option listed to be able to post the poll <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16972330">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16972330</a>   1.02%(1)

3. Kang (I&amp;#39;ll try for 70 minutes!) <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16972337">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16972337</a> (added by: ykleetx . December 23, 2015 10:17:52 AM PST)  13.27%(13)
<br />
4. Tom Sova.  My favorite classes are Intermediate Stick .To stay competitive and keep the class alive I sure could use some y2k2. Have been trying for 3 yrs to obtain a roll. If I continue building I may even get interested in F1d again. Thank you for your consideration. <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16972398">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16972398</a> (added by: tsovaf1d .

<br />
5. Josh Finn. Looking to built a lighter, better HLS and perhaps a competitive Intermediate as well. Hardly anybody&amp;#39;s flying either in low ceiling these days and it would be nice to change that. <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16972423">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16972423</a> (added by: joshuawfinn .

<br />
6. Wyatt Wear. I am a 16-year-old indoor flyer on the US Junior F1D team. I am very short on indoor supplies and have been searching for the opportunity to buy a good rubber stripper since I decided to try for the team and get serious about indoor flying. I also fly F1M and LPP, and am planning to pick up 35cm in the near future. <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16972417">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16972417</a> (added by: jamor00 . December 24, 2015 6:04:45 AM PST)   5.10%(5)
<br />
7. Vladimir Linardic. Being brought up flying indoor and leaving the hobby for a while found when recently coming back to it a need to update supplies and reorganize the shop to build up to building. By obtaining film it would make sense to again build unlimited clases like Intermediate stick, 35 centimeter and easy b and keep these classes represented in competition where with the film available today it is not feasable option for these to be competetive, therefore, I expres my interest in the purchase of Stan s Y2K/Y2K2 film. <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16972463">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16972463</a> (added by: linardic . December 24, 2015 1:00:36 PM PST)   6.12%(6)
<br />
8. Mike Kirda - Like most others here, I came back to indoor after a 30 year hiatus to find many materials almost impossible to obtain. I would very much like to have a hand at HLS in 2016 given that we have Rantoul available to fly in. I appreciate the consideration. <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16972478">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16972478</a> (added by: mkirda_at_sbcglobal.net . December 25, 2015 1:07:05 PM PST)  10.20%(10)
<br />
9. Brett Sanborn (nominated by John Kagan): I have seen Brett use this film on his high-performance carbon F1D props.  His record speaks for itself, and I believe he (and, as a result, the US F1D Team) would benefit from a roll <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16973623">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16973623</a> (added by: john_kagan .

<br />
10. Jeff Annis (nominated by Mike Kirda): Another long time flyer back into F1D after a hiatus. He could also benefit from a roll. <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16973642">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16973642</a> (added by: mkirda_at_sbcglobal.net . January 6, 2016 8:46:12 AM PST)   4.08%(4)
<br />
11. Jake Palmer - My current best time in EZB is around 28 minutes with a 400mg model at Kibbie Dome.  I&amp;#39;d like to push my weight down to 350 or less and break the 30 minute barrier.  I also have a goal to break 40 minutes with an intermediate stick at the Kibbie Dome. <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16973643">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16973643</a> (added by: jakep_82 . January 6, 2016 8:48:08 AM PST)   4.08%(4)
<br />
12. Nick Ray (nomitated by Mike Kirda): A former US F1D team member who I&amp;#39;m sure could benefit from a roll. <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16973666">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16973666</a> (added by: mkirda_at_sbcglobal.net . January 6, 2016 8:50:15 AM PST)   4.08%(4)
<br />
13. Steve Fujikawa - If I get a roll I&amp;#39;ll donate $100 to the F1D team. <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16973715">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16973715</a> (added by: steve_fujikawa . January 6, 2016 12:27:41 PM PST)   5.10%(5)
<br />
14. David Phillips - If I can get a roll at $100? or even 1/2 roll I&amp;#39;ll use it for future F1Ds and also make it available (no profit) to my Glastonbury CT Aeromodelers club members, some of whom fly F1D, F1L. Thank you for your consideration <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16973729">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16973729</a> (added by: john_kagan .

<br />
15. Tony Hebb - I fly F1R in the UK and hold 2 National records (CAT 1 and CAT 3) - I&amp;#39;d love to get a 30min  flight in our 65&amp;#39; Brabazon hangar but need a really light model to do so. I&amp;#39;ve achieved 400mg with OS2 film but could use the extra few milligrams that Y2K2 would give me. <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16973820">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16973820</a> (added by: mkirda_at_sbcglobal.net .

<br />
16. I nominate Bill Gowen for a roll in the hopes that he will get back into F1R. <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16973960">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Indoor_Construction/polls/poll/2515748#16973960</a> (added by: lasrayiff .
