People, especially Don D., need to look at the total cost to attend an event.  In the past, the Kibbie entry fee for 5 days of flying at over12 hours per day has been a fantastic bargain.  Although Moscow, Idaho, is away from some major population centers, Spokane and Seattle notwithstanding, it is not that bad if one stays for all five days.  Additionally, the rate for the University Inn is very good considering what one gets for the price (and, in past years, the rate has not been all that much more than the Super 8).  Plus, there area couple of very inexpensive places if all one wants is basic accommodations. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;BTW, I have looked at the costs to fly at the AMA outdoor site in Muncie during the summer and Kibbie is not a bad deal overall.  Furthermore, thew driving time from the Indy airport to Muncie AMA field is about the same as from the Spokane airport to the Kibbie Dome.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I would hope that the event is kept to five days.  There are some fixed costs associated with the Dome rental and having more days allows these costs to be shared over more days.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;In the past there have been some international fliers at Kibbie.  I was disappointed that there were none from Europe last year.  There will also be few this year as many will be going to the Indoor WC in Slanic.  Also, last year's turnout, including those from Europe, was low in part because the dates of the contest were announced quite late and the dates, June 25-29, 2015, closely followed the Nats in Colorado Springs, June 8-12,2015.  Also the late June dates were a week earlier than in the past when the dates were close July 4th.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;One change last year was to extend the time each day.  The Dome was open quite early (7am-8am, I recall but indoor rubber fliers get up late) and this allowed a large block of time for the gliders.  I would hope this might happen again and that more glider pilots would attend.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;The event last year needed 30 fliers at the $200 entry fee (open fliers) to cover expenses.  I would hope that this can be done again.  Also, I would hope that a non-conflicting date can be found.
<br />
