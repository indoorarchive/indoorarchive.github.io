For those who haven't seen it, there is an article on INAV by Wally Miller proposing a set of rules changes. Given what has happened with recent proposals slipping in unopposed for lack of public circulation, it behooves us to consider the ramifications now rather than when the proposals get submitted for votes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Obviously a proposal to modify A-6, LPP, or Ministick isn't going to go anywhere.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;What worries me is the proposal to change Intermediate Stick and AROG (F1R is safe, being an FAI class not likely to change soon, but we need to address it in a minute, too). I've flown Intermediate a little and rather like it. Yes, a difficult class, but a nice way to hit 40 minutes in competition without a giant model. AROG seems to be the red-headed stepchild these days and that saddens me. As best I can tell, AROG is the oldest unmodified competition class for any form of model airplane in the world that is still flown. With a built-up propeller, an AROG published in 1935 would be reasonably competitive today--that's how little things have changed. The flight times in high ceilings haven't increased as much since the 30's as one would think either! As such, I truly believe this class deserves more publicity. It is an aerospace treasure, and probably completely unique in its status. I personally do fly AROG, and I'd like more folks to do it with me. Yes they are fiddly, but I find them to be fun, too. You don't have to hit 200 mg to be competitive. Mine are 350 or so and I get 4+ minute quarter motor flights in my living room. They can turn wonderfully tight little circles.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;F1R deserves similar attention to AROG. The earliest reference I can find to it is in the early 1950's. Does anyone know when it was started? I do know that for all intents and purposes the rules have never been modified although some nations have adopted their own versions with limitations on covering material, and Serbia and the UK have successful and popular beginner's classes built around F1R.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Anyway, I just thought the other side of the history lesson might be of value. Others might disagree. What we need is perhaps a little awareness and maybe new attention on these classes.
<br />
