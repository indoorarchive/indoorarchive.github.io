I think any new event needs to vetted at indoor contests before 
<br />
considering deleting any current AMA events. I am not sure if making a 
<br />
rule proposal for a new event and voting on it to be an AMA event is the 
<br />
correct way to see if people like it. Sounds more like throwing stuff to 
<br />
a wall to make it stick.  I think the progression should be a new new 
<br />
event is proposed then see if people fly it, work out the rules issues 
<br />
if any come up after a few seasons of flying it, then move on to AMA 
<br />
adoption if appropriate. Some events I think are low participation 
<br />
because they are not flown at any contests.
<br />
<br />I think an interesting exercise would for people to look at the current 
<br />
AMA list of events and write down why they don't fly a certain event or 
<br />
what the do not like about an event. Perhaps that will lead to some 
<br />
conclusions. For example. I no longer fly Open Pennyplane as to be 
<br />
competitive you need a biplane and I would rather fly a wide chord 
<br />
monoplane but a monoplane needs to be longer and the rules wont allow so 
<br />
a wide chord monoplane has stability issues when very short so I have 
<br />
lost interest in the event.  If monoplanes were allowed to be 24&quot; OAL 
<br />
instead of 20&quot; I would probably fly Open Pennyplane again.
