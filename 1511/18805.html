<br /><br />PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (INCUMBENT): JOHN LORBIECKI
<br />
<br /><br />Well, never say never.
<br />
<br /><br />After much soul searching and looking at other considerations, I have 
<br />
decided to run again for President of the National Free Flight Society. 
<br />
By now, the membership has a good idea of my background. But for those 
<br />
of you who I have never met, here is a brief rundown on my background.
<br />
I am a senior mechanical engineer for GE Healthcare, working primarily 
<br />
on R&amp;D projects used on magnetic resonance systems. I am a certified 
<br />
flight instructor with a commercial and instrument rating. Our family 
<br />
owns a Cherokee 180 which has been used for personal and business use 
<br />
(plus, I trained my son John in it for his private pilot’s license; he 
<br />
is now training in an F-16 for the Madison Air National Guard). Not only 
<br />
do I have flying as a hobby but also I drag race. We have two dragsters 
<br />
that run in the 7-second range at over 170 mph. I built everything on 
<br />
these cars, from the basic chassis to the engines.
<br />
<br /><br />My modeling career started at the age of 5 flying control line models. 
<br />
The original club I belonged was multi-functional, with members flying 
<br />
control line, R/C, and Free Flight. I fell in love with FF and that 
<br />
started a 50-year hobby. With folks like Dick Swenson, Gil Graunke, Bob 
<br />
Whaley, George Versaw, Rol Andersen, Hardy Brodersen, Tony Italiano, and 
<br />
many others I concentrated on FAI power and powered AMA events. I enjoy 
<br />
towline and have flown it most of my life. HLG was a biggy for many 
<br />
years until the arm went away. I even twisted a few rubber bands some.
<br />
<br /><br />As a long-time member of the Bong Eagles, I got involved in running 
<br />
various contests. With Tony’s help, I was assistant to him in running an 
<br />
indoor WC at Johnson City. I have been an assistant and overall CD of 
<br />
multiple Nats as well as being a Sympo editor.
<br />
<br /><br />My son and I got involved in the Junior FF Team program and had good 
<br />
success there, with him being the 2004 World Champ, 2002 runner up, and 
<br />
a good showing in 2007 in F1C in the Ukraine. Through these 
<br />
competitions, I have met many FAI fliers and made friends worldwide. All 
<br />
of these relationships have helped me in the first four years of being 
<br />
the NFFS President.
<br />
<br /><br />With the help of a great board and volunteers, we have moved NFFS ahead. 
<br />
The Digest went to full color and we were able to actually save money in 
<br />
its production. The plans service, which was losing money, was reworked 
<br />
and turned into a money maker. Board members used to meet only twice a 
<br />
year (with a cost of over $3000 for one of the meetings) and I changed 
<br />
this to a minimum of monthly telecons. This improved the communications 
<br />
between us and saved NFFS money. I set up multiple internet and email 
<br />
specials for selling products to our membership. As President, I have 
<br />
helped manage the Outdoor Nats all four years, running the banquet and 
<br />
auction. Plus, we have had a balanced budget (thanks Frannie!) and have 
<br />
not had to hit any of our savings. The website has been used more (with 
<br />
Alan Peterson’s excellent work) and soon will have a new service to make 
<br />
it even better. We have worked with AMA to promote FF and with their 
<br />
help we have been able to change various systems in regards to the Nats 
<br />
and other functions.
<br />
<br /><br />As with any organization, we do run into problems. One major problem was 
<br />
the sudden death of our membership chairman. The board and I were able 
<br />
to work through this in a very timely manner and minimize the impact to 
<br />
our membership. The plans service was also an area in which rapid action 
<br />
needed to be done and we were able to make this transition seamlessly.
<br />
<br /><br />But, there is always more to do. We have worked hard at improving all 
<br />
our services to our members. We still need to continue to look at 
<br />
increasing (or at least maintaining) our membership. We need to continue 
<br />
providing the excellent Digest (big thanks to Don DeLoach and his 
<br />
efforts) as well as making the Sympo an excellent resource for technical 
<br />
and practical articles. The Indoor community is improving and I feel we 
<br />
have some interesting things happening in the near future. Plus, we have 
<br />
to keep the Nats the best run contest in the country. All of these are 
<br />
just a continuation of what we already are doing.
<br />
<br /><br />So, I hope that you feel the way I do and want me to try and finish off 
<br />
what I have started. It has been a great four years and I have met so 
<br />
many folks that I never would have if it wasn’t for NFFS. I ask you to 
<br />
vote and hopefully we can keep making NFFS an organization we all can be 
<br />
proud of.
<br />
<br /><br />Thanks for your consideration.
<br />
<br /><br />John Lorbiecki, Hubertus, Wisc.

<br /><br /><br /><br />PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: DENNIS TYSON
<br />
<br /><br />I would like to be able to start this off with a long list of how many 
<br />
National Championships I’ve won but that’s just not the case. Instead, I 
<br />
would like to share with you my passion for Free Flight of all 
<br />
disciplines. I’ve been a member of NFFS for about five years now and 
<br />
always look forward to the next Digest and tend to read them cover to 
<br />
cover. Before I became a member, a nice gentleman in Indiana, who’s name 
<br />
I wish I could remember, sent me a few back issues of the Digest and I 
<br />
was hooked.
<br />
<br /><br />Here are some of the basics about me and my interest in Aviation.
<br />
I started flying RC when I was about 15 years old, wow; I guess that’s 
<br />
36 years ago. I have flown all types including early ducted fan jets. 
<br />
The most fun for me is just doing lazy aerobatics and old school pattern 
<br />
maneuvers. I also love Thermal Duration glider flying.
<br />
<br /><br />I spent four years in the Air Force and 11 years in the Air National 
<br />
Guard. In the Guard I was a fuel systems specialist on KC135, F-106, and 
<br />
F-16s. If you love airplanes, there nothing like working on the military 
<br />
ones.
<br />
<br /><br />I got my private Pilot’s License in 1995. I have been a member of the 
<br />
EAA since 2001 and have built and flown a Minimax, and have been working 
<br />
on a Sonerai 2 LS for the past six years. I also serve the EAA as a 
<br />
Technical Counselor.
<br />
<br /><br />I got my start in Free Flight in about 2004 when I would take my 
<br />
daughter Alexa to Grand Rapids to fly in a gym a couple times a month. 
<br />
It was an amazing introduction and we flew the pants off of Right 
<br />
Flyers. There were many mass launches directed by a gentleman named Karl.
<br />
<br /><br />Jeff Hood was the first major influence we had and due to him answering 
<br />
all of my thousands of questions early on, we began to dig deeper into 
<br />
the world of Indoor. Jeff hosted the first contest we ever attended. 
<br />
Then it was Kent State, USIC at Johnson City, Lakehurst, Kent State, and 
<br />
so on.
<br />
<br /><br />My son Parker was one of the Juniors competing in F1D in Belgrade, 
<br />
Serbia in 2010 and placed 3rd. We returned in 2012 and both of my sons 
<br />
competed and I was the Junior Team Manager. I wouldn’t trade the time 
<br />
spent with them traveling and competing in Free Flight for anything. It 
<br />
will be some of the best memories of my life.
<br />
<br /><br />We decided to give Outdoor a try a few years ago and competed at the 
<br />
Outdoor Nats We flew HLG and P-30. This was another set of learning 
<br />
curves that I am still learning. So now my fleet consist of a Super 
<br />
Pearl 202e, another Pearl for A/B Electric, a Becker Nostalgia Rubber, 
<br />
Gollywock, Senator, a couple of P-30s and a handful of planes for FAC 
<br />
competition.
<br />
<br /><br />My contest flying has been scarce for the past few years due to a 
<br />
college graduation of my daughter and high school graduation of my first 
<br />
son, and now getting him settled into Embry Riddle. But I’m coming back!
<br />
<br /><br />One of my joys relating to Free Flight has been to find great items that 
<br />
were no longer available to the Free Flight community and figuring out 
<br />
how to make them, improving on them if possible and offering them for 
<br />
sale again. I’ve built glue applicators, balsa strippers, winding 
<br />
stooges, yellow winder brakes, and now torque meters for Outdoor Free 
<br />
Flight. I really enjoy this process and am always happy to see them out 
<br />
in the field being enjoyed. This was one of the ways we helped to fund 
<br />
our two trips to the F1D World Champs.
<br />
<br /><br />In my professional career I have been the Director of Construction for 
<br />
Family Christian for the past 16 years and have been with the company 
<br />
for 24 years. I manage store design, construction, and facilities for 
<br />
our chain of 250 stores. Our home is in Hastings, Michigan which is nice 
<br />
as we only have a three-hour drive to Muncie.
<br />
<br /><br />So my interest in being the NFFS President is somewhat selfish. I don’t 
<br />
profess to being an expert but instead am interested in broadening my 
<br />
knowledge and understanding of Free Flight as a whole. I want to learn 
<br />
more about the Outdoor FAI events, the FAC, and meet more of the 
<br />
characters that I’ve only heard about. I’m good at asking questions in 
<br />
an attempt to dig deeper into subjects. I like the idea of making a 
<br />
contribution to move all of Free Flight forward and helping to secure 
<br />
its future. I would like your consideration for this important role.
<br />
<br /><br />Dennis A Tyson, Hastings, Mich.
