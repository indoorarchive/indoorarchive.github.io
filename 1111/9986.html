Joshua,
<br />
<br />Very impressive times with the helicopter! Do you happen to have any pictures of it?

This ended up being a really fun event, though my flying overall was pretty lame. My new F1D was a bust, and the old one I pulled out ended up a victim of stupidity.
Helicopter was the bright spot, and there is definitely room for significant improvement.
If I could steer competently, that LPP score would be higher...
It's a very good flying site. Smooth outer ceiling close to the Cat I limit with a slot to much higher for the bold (and the stupid, like me). It's a challenge in sunny weather, though, with the windows allowing noticeable thermals below 15'.

&gt; Another great day of flying was had at St. Lukes on Saturday, November 19. Six fliers recorded
&gt; approximately 45 official attempts at State or National records during the day. No National records fell
&gt; but the Georgia State records took quite a beating. A special treat was the presence of Jim Richmond
&gt; and his wife who flew in from their home in Indiana to participate. 
&gt; 
&gt; Here is a listing of recorded flights

&gt; &gt; PEACH STATE INDOOR RECORD TRIALS
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; November 19, 2011 9am-4pm
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The Thermal Thumbers of Metro Atlanta are hosting our inaugural indoor
&gt; &gt; record trials
&gt; &gt; in the Great Hall at St. Lukes Presbyterian Church in Dunwoody, GA, where
&gt; &gt; we've been
&gt; &gt; flying for years. The Great Hall is a great category I site with a ceiling
&gt; &gt; height just three
&gt; &gt; inches below the maximum. The room is drift-free and offers a smooth ceiling
&gt; &gt; with few
&gt; &gt; hazards, and the walls are cushioned. The room also features a long, vaulted
&gt; &gt; ceiling
&gt; &gt; running down the center of the room that offers several more feet in height.
&gt; &gt; This is a
&gt; &gt; good room for setting records, as Bill Gowen has done recently in F1M AMA
&gt; &gt; and A-
&gt; &gt; 6. A review of the AMA's indoor records reveals many are over twenty years
&gt; &gt; old. This
&gt; &gt; presents an opportunity for more modern designs and aggressive fliers.
&gt; &gt; St. Lukes is located in the northern Atlanta suburbs and is very convenient
&gt; &gt; to hotels,
&gt; &gt; restaurants, and shopping, including nearby Perimeter Center mall. The
&gt; &gt; immediate
&gt; &gt; area can be reached directly from the airport via the MARTA train. St. Lukes
&gt; &gt; is on Mt.
&gt; &gt; Vernon Rd. about one mile west of Ashford Dunwoody Rd. Detailed maps to the
&gt; &gt; site can
&gt; &gt; be found at thermalthumbers.com.
&gt; &gt; The CD will be David Mills (AMA #7717), and he can be contacted at
&gt; &gt; 404-509-4209
&gt; &gt; or davidmillsatl_at_ . AMA membership is required to fly. Adult fliers
&gt; &gt; will be
&gt; &gt; charged a fee of $10.00; kids can fly for free. Flying starts at 8:00 am and
&gt; &gt; ends at 5:00
&gt; &gt; pm. Come see us and make your mark. Good luck!
&gt; &gt;
