At the risk of sounding like broken record, I'll put in my 2 cents as an indoor newbi.  
<br />
<br /><br />I've been building FF models for over 40 years, but indoor only the last 2 years.  My first model was a LPP built with light outdoor wood and covered in indoor mylar.  It was relatively easy to build to weight and flies great for me.  Since I had been using mylar on my outdoor rubber models, I found the transition to indoor fairly easy.  
<br />
<br /><br />The second model I built was an A-6.  It, too, flies great for me, but the construction process was much more difficult due to having to source indoor wood for the framework in order to make weight with the 450mg sq&quot; paper I have.  It still came out slightly overweight and the paper covering was harder to make look good.
<br />
<br /><br />I have since built 3 ministicks and an F1L.  The ministicks are, by far, the most difficult to build due to the wood sizes involved.  
<br />
<br /><br />If a beginner would ask me what to build, I would recommend the LPP then the F1L.  As it is now, I wouldn't recommend the A-6. Allowing indoor mylar would make it much more desirable as a first model.

<br />At the suggestion of Ray Harlan we weighed a sample of this C. paper and it came in at 425 mg/100 Sq. in.
<br />
This is the good stuff as the previously available was in the range of 600 mg/100.

You might have seen the response to my offer by Donald  Slusarczyk posted on this site.  So, here is the question you need to ask your self when you read his response to this offer.  How is changing the basic specifications to indoor's only event designed for the novice indoor flyer going to help this phase of the indoor community grow?
<br />
Changing the specifications to allow a 33% lighter (worse case) covering means that the basic structure of the model can now be heavier. This means that the resulting model will be able to carry higher torque at launch resulting in higher flight performance.  Existing national records will be quickly replace by these new rule models.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The indoor phase of free flight is not enjoying growth.&amp;nbs p; How will making indoor's only novice event help to bring more people into this phase of the hobby?  Lower numbers of flyers means that the cost of venues has to be divided
<br />
be a lower number of flyers.  This will accelerate the decline of this great phase of the hobby.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
My offer of free high quality C. paper stands if and only if the indoor contest board do not vote to change the A-6 rules as proposed in IFF-15-5.  Make sure your board member hears from you as the voting process is starting and votes must be at AMA by September 15.

Subject: Plastic Covering for A-6 Rule Change Proposal
<br />
Date: Wed, 3 Sep 2014 12:11:02 -0600
<br />
<br /><br />Hello fellow A-6 competitors, 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
As you know the indoor contest Board will be voting shortly on a proposal to allow plastic covering for the A-6
<br />
models. The reason for this proposal is a belief that condenser paper is no longer available.
<br />
many modelers are not happy with this proposal for several reasons.  The first is it will wipe our years of records and the second is plastic film is not as easy to handle as paper.   The use of plastic film on the A-6 models will make them harder to build which will not support the idea that this class of models will bring new people into the fun world of indoor free flight.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
So, here is the deal.  I have discovered a large inventory of very high quality condenser paper which means the basic reason for this proposal is no longer valid. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
IF THE INDOOR CONTEST BOARD REJECTS THE PLASTIC COVERING PROPOSAL (IFF-15-5), I WILL MAKE THIS HIGH QUALITY C ONDENSER PAPER  AVAILABLE FOR FREE!
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Here are the details.  If and only if the indoor Contest Board rejects proposal IFF-15-6 I will provide enough condenser paper to cover two models for free.  The person requesting the condenser paper must send me a letter size self addressed envelope and I will return it with the condenser paper.  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
So there it is.  Contact your Indoor Contest Board member and tell them to reject IFF-15-5.
<br />
