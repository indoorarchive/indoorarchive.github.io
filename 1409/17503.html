<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You might have seen the response to my offer by Donald Slusarczyk 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; posted on this site.  So, here is the question you need to ask your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self when you read his response to this offer.  How is changing the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basic specifications to indoor's only event designed for the novice 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indoor flyer going to help this phase of the indoor community grow?
</em><br />
*I fail to see how the growth of the Indoor Free Flight community is 
<br />
directly based on whether an A-6 is covered with tissue or plastic film. 
<br />
However, the success of those who have built A-6 models and making them 
<br />
to weight is directly related to what they are covered with. That is 
<br />
what this rule proposal addresses. There are already testimonials from 
<br />
other indoor modelers as to how condenser has made it difficult for 
<br />
adults and students alike building A-6 models to achieve the minimum 
<br />
weight. Don't believe me believe them.
<br />
<br />I can only surmise from your posed question that your idea as the best 
<br />
way help the novice indoor community grow is to tie the hands of novices 
<br />
and deny them the ability to use common indoor materials needed to make 
<br />
a model down to weight and force them to buy expensive sub 4# wood to 
<br />
build their A-6 models from? If anything would dissuade the &quot;indoor 
<br />
community from growing&quot; it would be to tell a novice that to build an 
<br />
A-6 will require custom ordering $50 worth of sub 4# wood that will 
<br />
break easily when their novice hands touch it. I think a novice would 
<br />
prefer to hear that they can build a model with wood from a local hobby 
<br />
shop and cover it with readily available plastic that they can then use 
<br />
to cover other indoor models as they progress into other indoor events.
<br />
<br />The purpose of this proposal is to give the novice the freedom as well 
<br />
as those who currently fly A-6 the opportunity to use either tissue or 
<br />
plastic. For those who love tissue covered A-6, absolutely nothing will 
<br />
change for them. For those who don't want to waste their 3.8# wood then 
<br />
they cans use plastic. *
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Changing the specifications to allow a 33% lighter (worse case) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; covering means that the basic structure of the model can now be heavier.
</em><br />
*Exactly! Something we both agree on. A-6 models now need 4# or less 
<br />
wood to make weight so allowing heavier wood will make it much easier 
<br />
for novices to find wood at a hobby shop and for them to handle the wood 
<br />
during building. Do you prefer novices have light wood weak models that 
<br />
break easily and warp from tissue changes? I fail to see how a tissue 
<br />
covered weak model is better for a novice than a plastic covered stiff 
<br />
model made from stronger wood?
<br />
*
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This means that the resulting model will be able to carry higher 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; torque at launch resulting in higher flight performance.  Existing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; national records will be quickly replace by these new rule models.
</em><br />
*Possibly but aren't records are meant to be broken anyhow? How is 
<br />
setting new records bad? Maybe some novices will be drawn to the event 
<br />
as they will now be able to build to weight after previously failing. 
<br />
Also I thought your main concern was in regards to novice modelers and 
<br />
growing the indoor community? Now the concern is protecting the existing 
<br />
records of experienced indoor modelers? I think any indoor &quot;expert&quot; 
<br />
knows an indoor record is only as good until another person comes along 
<br />
and breaks it. *
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The indoor phase of free flight is not enjoying growth.
</em><br />
*This sounds very familiar.......*
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Lower numbers of flyers means that the cost of venues has to be divided
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be a lower number of flyers.  This will accelerate the decline of this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; great phase of the hobby.
</em><br />
*So allowing plastic on A-6 will indirectly lead to the demise of Indoor? *
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My offer of free high quality C. paper stands if and only if the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indoor contest board do not vote to change the A-6 rules as proposed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in IFF-15-5.
</em><br />
*Why not throw in some 5/99 as well :-) *
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Make sure your board member hears from you as the voting process is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; starting and votes must be at AMA by September 15.
</em><br />
*Yes! Makes sure you board member does hear from you on your opinion. 
<br />
You all know mine and my reasoning. If you are not sure who your Indoor 
<br />
Board Member is they are all listed here with email contacts:
