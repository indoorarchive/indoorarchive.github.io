Dear Indoor Contest Board Members,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sending this letter in response to the email and post to the 
<br />
Indoor Construction Mailing list  recently sent by Jeff Murphy in 
<br />
regards to the proposal IFF-15-5 which is a proposal to allow the use of 
<br />
plastic covering in the A-6 event. I fear there is some misinformation 
<br />
in regards to what my proposal actually says. In the past the word for 
<br />
word proposals were published in the AMA Model Aviation magazine for all 
<br />
AMA members. Now they are only published on the AMA website and unless 
<br />
people are aware of that and know where to look on the AMA website to 
<br />
read them, they don't know what exactly is proposed. It seems word of 
<br />
mouth is how these proposals are being communicated by some and 
<br />
consequently some inaccurate information becomes disseminated by this 
<br />
method.
<br />
<br />Below are my responses to Mr Murphy's post on the Indoor mailing list, 
<br />
his post there is similar to the message emailed to all indoor board 
<br />
members. My replies to Mr.Murphy are highlighted in red below.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hello fellow A-6 competitors,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As you know the indoor contest Board will be voting shortly on a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposal to allow plastic covering for the A-6
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; models. The reason for this proposal is a belief that condenser paper 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is no longer available.
</em><br />
<br />Jerry,
<br />
<br />As the proposer of the rule change, the exact reason for my proposal is 
<br />
as follows (copied from my rules change submission):
<br />
<br />*Logic behind proposed change, including alleged shortcomings of the 
<br />
present rules.*
<br />
A-6 has a 1.2 gram minimum weight. The paper covering requirement makes 
<br />
it difficult to achieve the min weight due the limited availability of 
<br />
lightweight condenser paper. Those who have been flying indoor for many 
<br />
years have personal stocks of lightweight condenser, but new modelers 
<br />
(who are the target demographic of A-6) will have to use the heavier 
<br />
condenser paper currently being sold. The new condenser paper is 
<br />
approximately 1.5 times heavier then the lightweight condenser sold many 
<br />
years ago. Because of the minimum wood size requirements of A-6, the 
<br />
heavier modern condenser paper requires the use of ~4 pound density 
<br />
balsa for the entire model. This forces new modelers to invest in 
<br />
contest grade indoor balsa to make weight. My 13 year old son built an 
<br />
A-6 and we needed my personal supply of lightweight condenser to get his 
<br />
model to make weight. By allowing plastic, heavier balsa can be used and 
<br />
the skills used in covering with plastic are directly transferrable to 
<br />
other indoor events such as  Limited Pennyplane, F1L etc. It seems it 
<br />
would make a more logical progression instead of forcing them to use a 
<br />
paper that is only good for this one event. Additionally, condenser 
<br />
covering paper requirements on other indoor events like Pennyplane, 
<br />
Manhattan Cabin, EZB, and Paper Stick (renamed to Int Stick) were 
<br />
dropped about 25 years ago in favor of plastic covering .
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; many modelers are not happy with this proposal for several reasons.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The first is it will wipe our years of records and the second is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plastic film is not as easy to handle as paper.
</em><br />
<br />This is incorrect. It will have no effect on current records. The rule 
<br />
change I have submitted does not ban tissue, it removes the tissue only 
<br />
requirement.
<br />
<br />Change from :&quot;The model shall be rubber powered and covered with paper.&quot;
<br />
To: &quot;The model shall be rubber powered and covered with paper or 
<br />
commercially available plastic; no microfilm allowed.&quot;
<br />
<br />So models which are tissue or plastic covered are both allowed under 
<br />
this proposal. So all records will stand. I have several A-6 models that 
<br />
I will leave covered in tissue as they are trimmed and fly great. So I 
<br />
will still fly those existing models tissue covered under the new rules.
<br />
<br />As far as plastic being easier to use than paper, that is subjective and 
<br />
personal preference. Condenser paper sags in high humidity and shrinks 
<br />
in low humidity high/temps. I recall when EZB was still condenser 
<br />
covered having to have saggy paper and Akron on the ground so when the 
<br />
model went to the roof and shrunk it would still be in trim. I had seen 
<br />
models fly to the top of the hangar and warp and come down only to relax 
<br />
one they were returned to floor level. I prefer plastic but if you still 
<br />
like paper then you are still free to use paper as you currently do 
<br />
under this rule proposal.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   The use of plastic film on the A-6 models will make them harder to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; build which will not support the idea that this class of models will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bring new people into the fun world of indoor free flight.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Once again it is not mandatory to use plastic under this proposal. The 
<br />
wording does not say the model must be plastic covered only. The 
<br />
proposal  says the model may be tissue or plastic covered.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, here is the deal.  I have discovered a large inventory of very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; high quality condenser paper which means the basic reason for this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposal is no longer valid.
</em><br />
<br />What is the weight of the condenser paper you have found? The ~mile roll 
<br />
I have is ~500 mg per 100 sq inches. The lightweight condenser I am 
<br />
referring to in this proposal is around 340mg per 100 sq inches.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IF THE INDOOR CONTEST BOARD REJECTS THE PLASTIC COVERING PROPOSAL 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (IFF-15-5), I WILL MAKE THIS HIGH QUALITY C ONDENSER PAPER AVAILABLE 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; FOR FREE!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here are the details.  If and only if the indoor Contest Board rejects 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposal IFF-15-6 I will provide enough condenser paper to cover two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; models for free.  The person requesting the condenser paper must send 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me a letter size self addressed envelope and I will return it with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; condenser paper.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So there it is.  Contact your Indoor Contest Board member and tell 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them to reject IFF-15-5.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I prefer people make a decision by the merits of the proposal and not 
<br />
because they are going to be rewarded for voting a certain way. I have 
<br />
miles of plastic film yet you do not see me using bribery of free 
<br />
plastic film to those who ask but only if the proposal passes. I 
<br />
understand you desire to keep the tissue covering but think that buying 
<br />
votes is never a winning strategy.
<br />
<br />To me it is clear that there is misinformation about IFF-15-5. I do not 
<br />
know what supply of condenser paper Mr Murphy is referring to, perhaps 
<br />
it is left over condenser from A2Z Corp (which has closed) as they are 
<br />
only ~70 miles away from each other. But the issue is not condenser 
<br />
paper being unavailable, it is indoor grade 330 mg per 100 sq. inch 
<br />
condenser paper is what is hard to find. However, even with this light 
<br />
tissue I still needed to have custom cut 3.8# C grain from England so I 
<br />
could make a prop light enough due to the 1/32&quot; thick minimum thickness 
<br />
requirement. My current A-6 also uses similarly custom cut 4# density 
<br />
wing and stab spars to get to weight. Allowing plastic removes this 
<br />
light wood necessity requirement and makes hobby shop or Sig contest 
<br />
grade usable again. Additionally, the statement that my proposal will 
<br />
eradicate all existing records is completely untrue. Plastic and tissue 
<br />
will both be allowed just as both are allowed for Manhattan Cabin, 
<br />
Limited Pennyplane, Pennyplane, EZB, and Inst Stick. Those who like 
<br />
tissue can keep using it just as before.
<br />
<br />If you have any questions about my proposal or want to discuss in more 
<br />
detail please feel free to email or call me.  I appreciate your 
<br />
consideration on my rebuttal and thank you for your time. Unlike Mr. 
<br />
Murphy, I will not be offering any rewards or compensation for you 
<br />
voting in favor of my proposal. I do not believe that is an appropriate 
<br />
way to handle such a situation as this. Instead I will ask that if you 
<br />
agree with the proposal I have submitted, then please vote for it.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
