Thank you Don, for your exhaustive reply to the paper/plastic covering
<br />
question. I applaud your lengthy and in-depth approach to a technical
<br />
concern with additional emotional content.
<br />
<br />Here I am a long time builder who has trouble just getting rudimentary
<br />
models built and flying, so full of admiration for one who has such special
<br />
building and flying skills with additional capabilities to address these
<br />
larger issues.
<br />
<br />Thank you again. Richard Ranney

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Indoor Contest Board Members,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I am sending this letter in response to the email and post to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indoor Construction Mailing list  recently sent by Jeff Murphy in regards
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the proposal IFF-15-5 which is a proposal to allow the use of plastic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; covering in the A-6 event. I fear there is some misinformation in regards
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to what my proposal actually says. In the past the word for word proposals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were published in the AMA Model Aviation magazine for all AMA members. Now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they are only published on the AMA website and unless people are aware of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that and know where to look on the AMA website to read them, they don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know what exactly is proposed. It seems word of mouth is how these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposals are being communicated by some and consequently some inaccurate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information becomes disseminated by this method.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Below are my responses to Mr Murphy's post on the Indoor mailing list, his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; post there is similar to the message emailed to all indoor board members.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My replies to Mr.Murphy are highlighted in red below.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Hello fellow A-6 competitors,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As you know the indoor contest Board will be voting shortly on a proposal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to allow plastic covering for the A-6
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; models. The reason for this proposal is a belief that condenser paper is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no longer available.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jerry,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As the proposer of the rule change, the exact reason for my proposal is as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follows (copied from my rules change submission):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *Logic behind proposed change, including alleged shortcomings of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; present rules.*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A-6 has a 1.2 gram minimum weight. The paper covering requirement makes it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficult to achieve the min weight due the limited availability of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lightweight condenser paper. Those who have been flying indoor for many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years have personal stocks of lightweight condenser, but new modelers (who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are the target demographic of A-6) will have to use the heavier condenser
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paper currently being sold. The new condenser paper is approximately 1.5
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times heavier then the lightweight condenser sold many years ago. Because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the minimum wood size requirements of A-6, the heavier modern condenser
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paper requires the use of ~4 pound density balsa for the entire model. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forces new modelers to invest in contest grade indoor balsa to make weight.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My 13 year old son built an A-6 and we needed my personal supply of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lightweight condenser to get his model to make weight. By allowing plastic,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heavier balsa can be used and the skills used in covering with plastic are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directly transferrable to other indoor events such as  Limited Pennyplane,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; F1L etc. It seems it would make a more logical progression instead of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forcing them to use a paper that is only good for this one event.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Additionally, condenser covering paper requirements on other indoor events
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like Pennyplane, Manhattan Cabin, EZB, and Paper Stick (renamed to Int
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stick) were dropped about 25 years ago in favor of plastic covering .
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   many modelers are not happy with this proposal for several reasons.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The first is it will wipe our years of records and the second is plastic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; film is not as easy to handle as paper.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is incorrect. It will have no effect on current records. The rule
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change I have submitted does not ban tissue, it removes the tissue only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; requirement.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Change from :&quot;The model shall be rubber powered and covered with paper.”
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To: “The model shall be rubber powered and covered with paper or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; commercially available plastic; no microfilm allowed.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So models which are tissue or plastic covered are both allowed under this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposal. So all records will stand. I have several A-6 models that I will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leave covered in tissue as they are trimmed and fly great. So I will still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fly those existing models tissue covered under the new rules.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As far as plastic being easier to use than paper, that is subjective and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal preference. Condenser paper sags in high humidity and shrinks in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; low humidity high/temps. I recall when EZB was still condenser covered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having to have saggy paper and Akron on the ground so when the model went
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the roof and shrunk it would still be in trim. I had seen models fly to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the top of the hangar and warp and come down only to relax one they were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; returned to floor level. I prefer plastic but if you still like paper then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are still free to use paper as you currently do under this rule
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The use of plastic film on the A-6 models will make them harder to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; build which will not support the idea that this class of models will bring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; new people into the fun world of indoor free flight.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Once again it is not mandatory to use plastic under this proposal. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wording does not say the model must be plastic covered only. The proposal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; says the model may be tissue or plastic covered.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   So, here is the deal.  I have discovered a large inventory of very high
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quality condenser paper which means the basic reason for this proposal is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no longer valid.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is the weight of the condenser paper you have found? The ~mile roll I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have is ~500 mg per 100 sq inches. The lightweight condenser I am referring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to in this proposal is around 340mg per 100 sq inches.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IF THE INDOOR CONTEST BOARD REJECTS THE PLASTIC COVERING PROPOSAL
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (IFF-15-5), I WILL MAKE THIS HIGH QUALITY C ONDENSER PAPER AVAILABLE FOR
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; FREE!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here are the details.  If and only if the indoor Contest Board rejects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposal IFF-15-6 I will provide enough condenser paper to cover two models
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for free.  The person requesting the condenser paper must send me a letter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; size self addressed envelope and I will return it with the condenser
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paper.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So there it is.  Contact your Indoor Contest Board member and tell them to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reject IFF-15-5.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I prefer people make a decision by the merits of the proposal and not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because they are going to be rewarded for voting a certain way. I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; miles of plastic film yet you do not see me using bribery of free plastic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; film to those who ask but only if the proposal passes. I understand you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; desire to keep the tissue covering but think that buying votes is never a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; winning strategy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To me it is clear that there is misinformation about IFF-15-5. I do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know what supply of condenser paper Mr Murphy is referring to, perhaps it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is left over condenser from A2Z Corp (which has closed) as they are only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ~70 miles away from each other. But the issue is not condenser paper being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unavailable, it is indoor grade 330 mg per 100 sq. inch condenser paper is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is hard to find. However, even with this light tissue I still needed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to have custom cut 3.8# C grain from England so I could make a prop light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough due to the 1/32&quot; thick minimum thickness requirement. My current A-6
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also uses similarly custom cut 4# density wing and stab spars to get to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weight. Allowing plastic removes this light wood necessity requirement and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes hobby shop or Sig contest grade usable again. Additionally, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement that my proposal will eradicate all existing records is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; completely untrue. Plastic and tissue will both be allowed just as both are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allowed for Manhattan Cabin, Limited Pennyplane, Pennyplane, EZB, and Inst
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stick. Those who like tissue can keep using it just as before.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you have any questions about my proposal or want to discuss in more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; detail please feel free to email or call me.  I appreciate your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consideration on my rebuttal and thank you for your time. Unlike Mr.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Murphy, I will not be offering any rewards or compensation for you voting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in favor of my proposal. I do not believe that is an appropriate way to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; handle such a situation as this. Instead I will ask that if you agree with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the proposal I have submitted, then please vote for it.
