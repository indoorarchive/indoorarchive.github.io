There's maybe more that needs to be said about this. Different people do 
<br />
things in different ways. When I'm at a contest I don't make a practice 
<br />
of seeking out people who are having trouble to see if I can help. But 
<br />
if anyone asks for my opinion or my help I will always try to give them 
<br />
as much as possible - even to the point in Colorado this year of losing 
<br />
track of the time I had to fly LPP on Saturday. This is my way of 
<br />
&quot;growing the sport&quot; - trying to keep people interested who might be 
<br />
feeling overwhelmed or discouraged or just inquisitive.
<br />
<br />Kang and I have both written extensively on HPA about indoor flying 
<br />
which is another way to get people interested or keep them interested. I 
<br />
can't say this has been an overwhelming success but it has produced a 
<br />
number of people who have given indoor a try or who intend to do so.
<br />
<br />When I started flying indoor one of the things that was a major problem 
<br />
for me was getting yelled at about something almost every time I flew. 
<br />
Unfortunately I saw this happening several times at USIC this year to 
<br />
people who had put out considerable time and money to be there for the 
<br />
first time. This is REALLY not the way to grow the sport and in the 
<br />
cases I saw it was the people running the contest who did the yelling.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Randy,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Based on my experience, I disagree. There are plenty of Indoorists who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are spending a significant amount of their time on projects to promote 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indoor.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Introspection isn't a bad thing, either. One of the best ways to prove 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to a newcomer that an activity is fun is to actually have fun doing it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Conversely, a great way to scare people off is to endlessly talk about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how Indoor is dying off (which it isn't), how it needs to be more fun 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (which it doesn't), or how the participants are out-of-touch elitists 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with unnatural abilities who don't care if anyone else joins (which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they aren't).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Certainly we will benefit by more participation. And the way to get it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is through exposure, and through health local activity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no need to panic, and change who we are and what we do.
