To all...
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
As someone who does this for the MMM Club,  I think that what is  needed is 
<br />
someone to step up to the plate...be the responsible party and take it  
<br />
over.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
In my &quot;travels&quot; I have figured out that the reason everyone wants to be a  
<br />
part of, but not he responsible party, is they don't know what they are 
<br />
getting  into nor what is involved.  Truth is, it's not that hard and there is a 
<br />
lot  of satisfaction.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
If I read the emails correctly, all of the pieces are in place, one just  
<br />
needs to step up and have the proper publishing software and profiency..   
<br />
I.E. Microsoft Word (or equal) and probably Adobe Acrobat to cut a pdf  file.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The hard part is getting good input and data to use.  I used to get  cuts 
<br />
from folks that would say...&quot;This would make a great article!&quot;...expecting  
<br />
me to dig stuff out of the woodwork.  If it was such a great article,  
<br />
provide some backup data and such.  The job is &quot;EDITOR&quot; not reporter.   Too many 
<br />
folks expect you do to the work in creating articles without adding  proper 
<br />
input.  Guess what..it never happens.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Long story short...you want to be the editor and compiler of the INAV and  
<br />
not the originator.  You do get a lot of input from all of the email  
<br />
traffic if one cares to edit and compile it.  It is very current, the  info on 
<br />
this site.  think about it...building tips, sources of  material..name it.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
And if anybody &quot;b**ches&quot; about it, tell them to step up to the plate.   
<br />
It's easy to be a critic, especially if you never have to step up or be  right.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
And yes...it does take time...and you are a volunteer.

<br /><br /><br /><br />Guys 
<br />
The cost of keeping a  website is very trivial, the main effort is 
<br />
constructing and maintaining it.  Ideally someone in our ranks would do it, 
<br />
hopefully for  free 
<br />
The cost of  registering a domain name is only around $10 per year, and 
<br />
server space is  cheap too, even if you go out and rent your own space, 
<br />
something like $50 a  year 
<br />
I have lots of unused  server space on the server I rent.  I have 750 GB of 
<br />
space that I rent  for $48 a year.  I run about a dozen model airplane 
<br />
related sites for  clubs, cottage industries, etc., some of which are heavily in 
<br />
terms of  pictures and I am only using less than 5% of the space I rent.    
<br />
I guess what I am  saying is I would be willing to carve out a wedge of my 
<br />
server and make it  available for free to whomever might be willing to do 
<br />
the website.    
<br />
The message here in  my email is the development and maintaining of the 
<br />
website itself is not  trivial, none if is hard, just time consuming.    
<br />
Here are some  websites I currently run and are part of that 5% mentioned 
<br />
above.  All of  them feature loads of high resolution pictures:

Like has been said  earlier, my recommendation is to keep things digital on 
<br />
a website, and keep  them free (the costs of the website are simply not 
<br />
worth charging fees  for) 
<br />
In my opinion, the  benefits to the hobby are worth far more than charging 
<br />
money to try and offset  any of the fees I mentioned above

Ah - 
<br />
<br />Nick - the domain name is paid up through  2016. The INAV website, while 
<br />
currently down, is still somewhere on Jeff's  servers and can probably be 
<br />
recovered so it will not need to be started from  scratch - but that has to be 
<br />
confirmed with Jeff. As for the old issues, until  the site went down, they 
<br />
were all made freely available (well - the 20 some  issues that we posted), 
<br />
and I would suggest it be kept free so more people can  access that info.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would be willing to help  with keeping INAV going, but I need some help

in
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a key few  areas.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know very little about designing web pages and so I  would need help
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; getting the site set up. Also, I am not currently a  position where I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; support the news letter if becomes a financial  liability.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here is what I propose:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would  like to go to a completely digital INAV. I know this will cause
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some  problems for a few of the subscribers but I am not willing to commit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  to printing and mailing hundreds of news letters. That seems to be the  
</em><br />
most
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time consuming part of the current process. If we go to a  completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; digital platform then I don't really see the need to  password protect the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; content of the news letter, because we would not  have to charge everyone 
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pay for mailings. We could password protect  the old issues if that would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make everyone if that is an issue. I  foresee creating a home page with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; links to PDFs of issues organized by  year. The site user would simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follow the link and download the PDF  to view the content. The user can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; print the issue if they want. Thus,  the only operating cost for INAV 
</em><br />
would
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be creating and hosting the  website.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have two ideas about how to cover the operating  cost:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We used the existing money to pay for server space and  maintaining the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; domain registration. $1000 dollars should cover these  cost for several
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Otherwise, we can have a  donate to INAV link on the page through paypal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The donations would be  used to cover the cost of maintaining domain name
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; registration server  space and server space.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As for the content itself:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The only real change would be that INAV would accept both digital and  
</em><br />
paper
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; submissions again. I would like to have maybe 4 or 5 volunteers  to help
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; review submitted content. This way no one person is  responsible for 
</em><br />
editing
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more than 10 pages or so over per quarter. I  think that's pretty 
</em><br />
manageable
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; work load.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then, I  would take the content and put it together in a PDF file and 
</em><br />
upload
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it  to the web page. I think this process could be kept up with very  
</em><br />
little
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effort from any one person after the initial site is set  up.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know this isn't construction related, so I apologize  for being off 
</em><br />
topic.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I just thought this is a discussion for the whole  community. Now fire

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; As a past editor of INAV (you might know me as the  guy lovingly 
</em><br />
referred
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; to by Van as &quot;that damn lawyer&quot;), I  think it would be a shame to see 
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; publication shuttered  after 40 years.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; So, I'd like to offer a  suggestion. When Jeff Hood and I were running 
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; newsletter,  we (mostly Jeff) built a new website for INAV, to which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;  password access allowed subscribers access to the latest issues. I  
</em><br />
secured
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the web address Indoornewsandviews.com which was  donated to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; publication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;  If a few folks were interested, it would not be difficult to keep the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt;&gt; publication going on line - add how to videos, a few articles etc.,  
</em><br />
and use
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the site as the new publication form. The site could  be kept free (if 
</em><br />
Jeff
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; continues to host on his server). If  not, there should be cash in the 
</em><br />
INAV
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; account still - we  handed over about $3K when the newsletter was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;  transferred.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; If people want to see INAV  survive, it will have to be a community
