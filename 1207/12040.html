<br />Great that you are stepping forward to save INAV.

<br />As you know NFFS Digest recently offered a .pdf option for our members. Feel

free to contact me off list for details.

<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I would be willing to help with keeping INAV going, but I need some help in
<br />
a key few areas. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I know very little about designing web pages and so I would need help
<br />
getting the site set up. Also, I am not currently a position where I can
<br />
support the news letter if becomes a financial liability. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Here is what I propose: 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I would like to go to a completely digital INAV. I know this will cause some
<br />
problems for a few of the subscribers but I am not willing to commit to
<br />
printing and mailing hundreds of news letters. That seems to be the most
<br />
time consuming part of the current process. If we go to a completely digital
<br />
platform then I don't really see the need to password protect the content of
<br />
the news letter, because we would not have to charge everyone to pay for
<br />
mailings. We could password protect the old issues if that would make
<br />
everyone if that is an issue. I foresee creating a home page with links to
<br />
PDFs of issues organized by year. The site user would simply follow the link
<br />
and download the PDF to view the content. The user can print the issue if
<br />
they want. Thus, the only operating cost for INAV would be creating and
<br />
hosting the website. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I have two ideas about how to cover the operating cost:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />We used the existing money to pay for server space and maintaining the
<br />
domain registration. $1000 dollars should cover these cost for several
<br />
years. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Otherwise, we can have a donate to INAV link on the page through paypal. The
<br />
donations would be used to cover the cost of maintaining domain name
<br />
registration server space and server space. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />As for the content itself: 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />The only real change would be that INAV would accept both digital and paper
<br />
submissions again. I would like to have maybe 4 or 5 volunteers to help
<br />
review submitted content. This way no one person is responsible for editing
<br />
more than 10 pages or so over per quarter. I think that's pretty manageable
<br />
work load. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Then, I would take the content and put it together in a PDF file and upload
<br />
it to the web page. I think this process could be kept up with very little
<br />
effort from any one person after the initial site is set up. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I know this isn't construction related, so I apologize for being off topic.
<br />
I just thought this is a discussion for the whole community. Now fire away
<br />
with suggestions and whatever else!

<br />Abram mentioned that he does have money left in the INAV account.  He was
<br />
offering to give it back to people with time left on their subscriptions or
<br />
donate it to the NFFS indoor fund.  I personally would rather see the money
<br />
go towards something like what you're proposing here.

<br />I haven't read the latest issue of INAV yet, but I am very sorry to hear
<br />
this. 
<br />
<br />As a past editor of INAV (you might know me as the guy lovingly referred to
<br />
by Van as &quot;that damn lawyer&quot;), I think it would be a shame to see the
<br />
publication shuttered after 40 years. 
<br />
<br />So, I'd like to offer a suggestion. When Jeff Hood and I were running the
<br />
newsletter, we (mostly Jeff) built a new website for INAV, to which password
<br />
access allowed subscribers access to the latest issues. I secured the web
<br />
address Indoornewsandviews.com which was donated to the publication. 
<br />
<br />If a few folks were interested, it would not be difficult to keep the
<br />
publication going on line - add how to videos, a few articles etc., and use
<br />
the site as the new publication form. The site could be kept free (if Jeff
<br />
continues to host on his server). If not, there should be cash in the INAV
<br />
account still - we handed over about $3K when the newsletter was
<br />
transferred. 
<br />
<br />If people want to see INAV survive, it will have to be a community effort. 
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
<br />Tony 
<br />
<br />PS - Just to make sure I'm not misleading anyone, I am not volunteering
<br />
here. I've put in my time.
