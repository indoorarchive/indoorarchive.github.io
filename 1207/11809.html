Randy,
<br />
<br />I appreciate your frank inputs and genuine desire to hold a constructive discussion.
<br />
<br />I and almost every dedicated indoor flier I know are extremely interesting in promoting Indoor Free Flight.  There are many actions that we are taking, both as an organized group and as individuals. We have a deep passion for indoor.  We are not naive to think that everything is fine.  And we know that not everything is broken.
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />
<br />-Kang 
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not much of an indoor flyer but I do read this message board most days.  I doubt the issue at hand is a naming convention but rather one of promoting indoor toward the goal of perpetuating the sport.  Certainly outdoor free flight has exactly the same problem. It hardly seems believable to me that any organization wouldn't have an interest in doing that.  Positive discussion to that end should often be an important part of this forum.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That said my observation is that dedicated indoorists are pretty introspective folks who aren't likely to lend themselves to the act of growing the sport.  It's second nature for Don D. and Murph to want to grow free flight whether it be indoor or outdoor and they are both competent indoorists by the way.  My view is that wanting progress for the sport or any activity often relies on the ability to see issues and take action.  I don't think their position is intended to run down indoor but rather a concern to make things better.  We should encourage that energy and not diffuse it with pointless criticism regardless of one's position.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the Indoor Construction Group is moderated just fine.  Tommy Lasorda the famous Dodger coach once said that managing is like holding a dove in your hands.  Hold it too tightly and you'll smother it.  Hold it too loosely and it will fly away.
