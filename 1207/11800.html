<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Well, Ren, we're talking about forms around which to roll tapered balsa tubes, My gut says the hexagon shape would cause kinks at 8 points around the tube...

<br /><br /><br />Hey guys,
<br />
 
<br />
I just had an idea. I make bamboo fly rods. In as much as the form would be hexagon in shape, do you think it would work for what we’re trying to do here???
<br />
I could taper these puppies to whatever I wanted to and if only the power fibers of the bamboo were used to make them, there would be hardly any flex at all.

<br /><br /><br /><br />Same problem here; even tried drill rod on my south bend with the traveling rest and tiny, tiny cuts, and the deflection was still unacceptable (not to mention genuinely scary whipping about of the work piece.  Aluminum and brass were an utter waste of time.
<br />
 
<br />
Many years ago, I bought a tapered STEEL tail-boom form, bright yellow in color with a threaded end and a hex fitting – clearly a ??? for some piece of machinery.  Mine is about 15” long, ~5/16” at the fat end, ~.070 at the thin end, and straight as a string.  Happy to post pics if there’s a scrounger out there who thinks he might recognize what the original purpose of the ??? was.  It APPEARS to be a piece that, due to fragility, was designed to be replaced fairly frequently – perhaps cheaply?

<br /><br /><br /><br />Bill,
<br />
I’ve tried turning down some boom forms on my lathe and the trouble I’m having is with the material flexing to the point that I just can’t get them done right now. If your friend is able to make them, I’d probably purchase one. In the mean time, I’m going to check in with some of the guys in another group I belong to, to see how I can overcome the present problems I’m having with making these booms.
<br />
 
<br />
Thanks and please keep me posted as to your success with these puppies,
<br />
Ren

<br /><br /><br />Hey Gang,
<br />
<br />Other than the .25 x .110 x 18 form that Ray Harlan sells, is anyone using other sized forms and if so, is there a commercial source or are are you having them made? or, are you using the Ray's form for smaller and shorter booms? I have a friend with a CNC lathe and we're have bartering some work back and forth so I'm looking into havinmg him make me some custom booms if practical.
<br />
