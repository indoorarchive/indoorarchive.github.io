The whole yelling thing is ridiculous, especially since half the time it comes from contest management and the other fliers are perfectly ok with what goes on.
<br />
<br />By the way, and this is to anyone concerned, several of us FAC fliers had a little caucus at USIC and the general concensus is that the mass launches, etc, are not at all well managed or properly organized. Fly to the rule book and so that folks are eligible for Kanones, and you might just see more than three people flying WWII Mass Launch (the most popular FAC event ever, but the way). Nocal is no better. All of the models flown are FAC legal, but you can't get a Kanone because six flights are used and the scoring is wrong. TTOMA used to have this problem, and then a couple months ago David Mills asked me about the rules and changed things accordingly.
<br />
<br />I think half of our internal PR issues would be solved by just making the rules clear, available up front, and then not yelling at people who have no clue that what they're doing is somehow wrong. I do not appreciate having glider flights DQ'ed because I didn't turn them in at the proper interval when I wasn't even told what that interval is until after the fact.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There its much to learn about indoor etiquette. On the other hand the people who think that yelling is the way to teach those things have a lot to learn about life in general. I'm afraid in this instance they are probably too old and cranky to care. Hopefully at some point (soon) some new blood will get involved.

I am exercising the power of the delete button every time his name comes up. I wish I didn't have to see it at all but life does have its challenges.
