<br />
About 5 years ago, when the sub 0.50g EZB began to show up more in competition, EZB's that were heavier became less competitive.  The sub .50g models had been around for another 5 years prior; for example, Coslick had been flying his Micro EZB in local competitions. But they didn't win at USIC until Richmond's .305g model won in 2005 (plus 2006 and 2008) and Zaluska .31g model won in 2007.  Since then, every winning EZB model has been 0.40g or under, and most in the low .3g range.
<br />
<br />(By the way, from 1992 to 2004, a 13-year span, the USIC EZB event was won by either Larry Coslick or Larry Cailliau.  Since 1995, the winning model has already weighed less than .55g.)
<br />
<br />As fewer fliers flew EZB's, gone were the days when the EZB was the most contested event at USIC.  The decline in participation was also due to the general decline in indoor participation.  Wanting to retain as many EZB fliers as possible, Coslick proposed that a minimum weight of 0.6g be added to the rules.  It is debatable whether this change would have had its intended consequence.  The proposal was voted down, so we shall never know.
<br />
<br />So, I think it is apt that we celebrate Larry's return by flying with the 0.6g minimum weight.  Not only is this the approximate weight of a Hobby Shopper, it gives us a chance to see how this minimum weight rule might have played out, as Larry had wanted.  How competitive is the 0.6g model?  More importantly, will the 0.6g rule  vastly increase the field of contestants? 
<br />
<br />I hope that many of you who come to the Kibbie contest build a 0.6g EZB for this contest.  I also hope that some of you may be motivated to come to the Kibbie contest to welcome Larry back and witness the master at work.
<br />
<br />Sincerely,
<br />
<br />-Kang

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's time to celebrate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Did you know that Larry Coslick and Steve Gardner's original Hobby Shop EZB article was published in 1997?  This year is the 15-year anniversary.  Whoever hasn't read that article, please leave the room!  It's one of the greatest &quot;gifts&quot; that has been given to indoor free flight.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is one other reason to celebrate.  This year, Larry will return to competition at the Kibbie Dome.  Larry has not attended USIC and the Kibbie contest since 2000.  Let's welcome him back.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would like to propose the Larry Coslick Hobby Shop EZB Contest, to be flown in one of the days during the 5-day Kibbie Dome Contest.  Details will be finalized later, as the CD for the Kibbie contest has not yet been determined.  I've already talked to Andrew Tagliafico and Larry about the contest, and they are both supportive. I'm invisioning a 5 or 6 round contest like the International EZB Contest held in the past at the Kibbie Dome. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If there is interest, I can also organize a postal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, what do you think?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Model Rules:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - AMA EZB rules, but with a minimum weight limit of 0.6 g
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - Any motor stick and tailboom lengths allowed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - Any fixed-pitch prop shape, diameter, pitch allowed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - Wing, Stab, and Rudder shapes must be like those of the Hobby Shop EZB
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The minimum weight of 0.6 g is specified so that some of those flat bellies can't bring a 0.3 g Hobby Shopper.  That includes Larry.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Variances permitted in the motor stick, boom, and prop will allow room to experiment with the best prop, motor, and CG location.
