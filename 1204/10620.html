Hi guys,
<br />
I just got back from my meeting with the board members.
<br />
We have two hangars available to us. The first is hangar E, which as you can see in my photos folder, is pretty large. It has a 20 odd foot ceiling and is about 100' long by about 75' wide. I was told that it is open to us for weekly, bi-weekly, monthly fly-ins, club meetings, classes we might wish to have and/or demonstrations. The folks here are really big on getting people excited about anything that has to do with aviation, at any level. Science Olympiad, Scouts, AMA events, you name it, they'd like it incorperated into their plans. I mention Science Olypiad because as of two years ago, there is the Central Florida Aviation Academy on site, <a href="http://www.polkacademies.com/cfaa/">http://www.polkacademies.com/cfaa/</a> , and the BoD would like to see a SO, Wright Stuff program implemented in the very near future.
<br />
The BoD would like to see hangar A used for indoor free flight competitions, be they local, semi-local, state-wide, Regional and/or National.That hangar promises us a thirty odd foot ceiling, 100' by 75' minimum flying area. If used for an annual major competition, we would have a 100' by almost 200' flying area and bleachers would be moved in for public seating.
<br />
The cost to us is minimal, in fact it is so minimal that it equals to &quot;FREE&quot;, as in no charge, gratis, zip, nada. 
<br />
They do ask that we clean-up after ourselves and leave the hangar as we found it.
<br />
They asked that I take care of the orginizing; that I give them a list of our &quot;rules&quot; (whatever they are, they insist we're a club), copy of the AMA members insurance benifits and forward all that to a Board member for presentation. We should be flying within a month.
<br />
<br />Now the &quot;CATCH&quot;...I've never organized anything like this before and could use any suggestions from the group, so feel free to advise and suggest...I'm all ears....
<br />
<br />I think this is a great oppertunity for Indoor Free Flight here in Florida. We have the second largest Air Show in the USA supporting our efforts and best of all, it's at no cost to us. The sky's the limit, guys. Let me know what you think, feel, ideas to make this venture even better...let's have a discussion.
<br />
<br />Regards to all,
<br />
Ren
