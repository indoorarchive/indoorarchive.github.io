The arguments given here are arguments made when the ID rule was first proposed.  But first let me answer some questions. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;The FAI people did not make an interpretation that applies to the AMA.  What I was told was that they always considered the rules as applying to FAI sanctioned events only.  The problem is that the AMA has adopted the class rules verbatim.  This problem could have been avoided had the FAI just included the indoor classes in the general regs marking rule.  However, this was not to be for various reasons including wanting to make the rule very visible.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;The AMA can pass a rule change to fix this.  An urgent rule change can be adopted.  I had suggested to Don that this be done some time ago.  If the AMA is in the process of adopting a rule to fix this, I see no reason why the CD cannot look the other way for a while.  If someone protests successfully, the Chair of the ICB can always reverse the decision.  We should not make this a bigger matter than it needs to be.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;The FAI wants a unique ID for each pilot. The FAI sporting Licence number changes with each renewal but the FAI unique ID is supposed to say the same even if a renewal is skipped or if there is not a renewal again.  This not to say that one person cannot end up with two &quot;unique&quot; IDs.  Such things can happen (and appear to have done so for a pilot or two entering the 2018 Indoor WC) but this is a near trivial problem to solve as the CD can have two (or more?) ID's to compare the the marking ID.  A members AMA number usually stays the same but the AMA does in certain circumstances change a member number.  The outdoor free flight community seems to live with such things.  So, this is not is not a big matter, either.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I personally think, as I said in a previous post, that indoor models should be marked just as outdoor models are marked.  This presents a quick and easy path for the AMA.  We just need to add to the AMA rules adopting the FAI indoor classes that models shall be marked with either the FAI unique ID number or the builder's AMA membership number prefixed by &quot;USA&quot;.  This outdoor fliers do this and so should the indoor fliers.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;This is getting to be a bigger problem than it need be.  It is an organizational problem for the 2018 Indoor WC because this is the first FAI contest where the rule is in effect.  We need to make sure that the models are marked correctly before the first processing for round one.  My post starting this thread was just to make sure the entrants were not surprised on Tuesday morning.  And, I will bring my marking pen to West Baden for all to use.  BTW, my FAI class models have all been marked since early last year and the marking have been the main reason my flight times have increased:).
