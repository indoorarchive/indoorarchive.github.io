Hi Bill, 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&quot;I think enforce ability would be a major issue&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I'd argue that enforceability is already an issue under the current BOM rules.  I vaguely remember someone suggesting recently that if we, collectively, want to outlaw purchased VP hubs we can submit a rule change proposal.  I think it's exactly the opposite: if we want to specifically allow purchased VP hubs, a rule change is required.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Clearly, there is a division at some point between &quot;materials&quot; and &quot;building a portion of the model&quot;, and that would be a suitable topic for the FAI jury to interpret.  I think the limits on either end are pretty clear: balsa, polyester film, and music wire are &quot;materials&quot; (you don't &quot;build&quot; balsa, film, or wire, except in the most abstract, philosophical sense).  A complete model is the ultimate &quot;built portion&quot;.  At some point in between is a threshold (I think it's somewhere around a Harlan bearing, but that's still pretty arbitrary).  It's pretty hard to argue that a VP hub isn't something you build.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Also it should be considered that allowing purchased hubs would remove a major stumbling block for fliers wanting to start out in F1D&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
As Leo effectively asserts with his F1D Jr model, a VP isn't required for F1D - especially for fliers just starting out.  Also, a WC caliber VP can be built using common materials, tools, and Steve Brown's article. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Both of these points (enforceability and hurdles) can be arguments for a rule change to do away with some of all of the BOM rule, but they aren't applicable to somehow &quot;interpreting&quot; that a component which is the result of non-trivial building effort is really just a &quot;material&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;IMO
<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John and all,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;My comment was made just to answer Aki's questions that the organizers are NOT making any decision or comment on the legality of using purchased vp hubs at the upcoming Indoor WC at West Baden.  Those rule interpretations, as John knows, are ultimately made by the Jury.  And, I do not know of any scheduled discussion of this issue at the WC.  The organizers will not be running the event as that is the job of the CD and the other officials, who all answer to the Jury if there are any problems (protests?) or issues that need clarification.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;We must all remember that rules need interpretations.  A good example is the explicit and seemingly clear FAI rule for F1D motors:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;3.4.2.  Maximum weight of the lubricated rubber motor ...........0.4 g.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;However, every flier, Including John, has been allowed to and does wipe their motor clean of debris and lube before weighing.  Without this allowance, the debris the lubed motor picks up upon landing on an often dirty floor would increase the weight of the motor.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Finally, the past and current use of purchased vp hubs is not an interpretation or change in the rules.  But, it is, as John knows, part of the larger picture of what has been and will be done at contests.  I think that too many fliers, including John, have looked the other way when non-top level fliers have used such parts in the past.  Now that some top level fliers are using purchased vp hubs while setting World and national records and will use them at the upcoming Indoor WC, it may be too late to change course.  This is especially so when it appears that a significant fraction of all F1D fliers use purchased vp hubs in sanctioned contests worldwide.  Maybe purchased vp hubs will be considered the same as purchased prop bearings with respect to the FAI's BOM rule.  We need to look at the best balance in such things.  We would not want to require that fliers cut their own balsa sheet from raw balsa lumber just as we may not want the purchase of fully assembled and complete planes either.  The question is where to draw the line and we must take into consideration everything from past and current use to enforceability when we decide.
<br />
