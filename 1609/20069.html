I have emailed all three presidential candidates with the same three
<br />
questions. I have copied and pasted their responses below to protect their
<br />
private email addresses when appropriate. The responses are in no
<br />
particular order. Please feel free to share these comments on other forums
<br />

<br />Hi Nick,
<br />
<br />1) If elected, how would you support Indoor and Outdoor Free Flight?
<br />
<br />Nick,I believe this hobby is great because of its diversity. All modeling
<br />
disciplines are important and must be supported and protected. Free Flight
<br />
is especially important as it is the legacy of model aviation. It is the
<br />
one activity that made all other modeling disciplines possible. As District
<br />
X VP from 1993 to 2008, I supported all of model aviation and made it a
<br />
point to visit and become involved in all aspects of the hobby, not the
<br />
least of which was Free Flight. I attended dozens of events at Lost Hills,
<br />
Taft, the Knoll at Sepulveda Basin, Perris Field, Eloy, Waegell Field and
<br />
others. I attend numerous banquets for the America's Cup and CUFFMAC, and
<br />
worked to get access to venues such as Hangar One at Moffett Field and the
<br />
blimp hangars at Tustin. As president I will continue to support and defend
<br />
all aspects of the hobby, including Free Flight
<br />
<br />&nbsp;2) How do you see the role of competition within the AMA?
<br />
<br />Competition has been the backbone of this great hobby and the catalyst for
<br />
innovation and new technology. AMA was founded on this principle and I will
<br />
serve to maintain competition as a fundamental and key element of the hobby.
<br />
<br />3) What is your stance on the AMA's involvement in FAI competitions?
<br />
<br />AMA has an important role to play on the world stage, and the FAI and world
<br />
competition is the conduit to fulfilling this role. We need to heighten the
<br />
importance of this activity and to celebrate our involvement and success.
<br />
Having said that, I believe there are ways that the FAI program can be
<br />
improved, and as president I will work with the competition community
<br />
towards heightening and improving this program and bringing it back to the
<br />
prominence it has held for decades.
<br />
<br />All the best,
<br />
<br />Rich Hanson

<br />Hi Nick,
<br />
Thanks again for reaching out to me. Below are my responses. Please feel
<br />
free to contact me with any other questions or suggestions.
<br />
<br /><br />1) If elected, how would you support Indoor and Outdoor Free Flight?
<br />
<br /><br />AMA must do more to highlight Free Flight - our first category of flight.
<br />
As the District II Vice President I have attended and reported on numerous
<br />
Free Fight events including; The Flying Aces Club NATS, The Brooklynn
<br />
Skyscrapers - Barron Field, Free Flight at the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome, and
<br />
indoor FF record attempts in D II. Providing greater exposure of Free
<br />
Flight to AMA members and the public is critically important.  As AMA
<br />
President I will work to increase the exposure and promotion of Free Flight
<br />
in AMA’s various publications, Internet sites, and other
<br />
outlets.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />2) How do you see the role of competition within the AMA?
<br />
<br />Competition provides significant benefits to our hobby, and serves to
<br />
promote and advance aeromodeling.  Competition represents the pinnacle of
<br />
aeromodeling skills, something all modelers can aspire to. Competitive
<br />
events can be attractive to the news media – a great way of promoting our
<br />
hobby.  As an educationally resource, competition provides a channel for
<br />
young people to learn not only hands-on aircraft skills, but also personal
<br />
skills like working with friends in competitive environments. AMA must work
<br />
to enhance and promote competition, and tell the story of competition for
<br />
all its great benefits and rewards.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />3) What is your stance on the AMA's involvement in FAI competitions?
<br />
<br />AMA involvement in FAI is integral to AMA’s stature as the World’s largest,
<br />
and leading, aeromodeling organization. FAI involvement enhances
<br />
aeromodeling’s credibility at home in the United States with educators,
<br />
opinion leaders, elected officials, and the public.  Wherever it can AMA
<br />
must foster and support competitive involvement.
<br />
<br /><br />Thanks!
<br />
Eric

<br /><br /><br />Nick,
<br />
Thank you for the chance to address the Free flight Community
<br />
<br />The first way I would support Free Flight as the AMA's President would be
<br />
to continue to do what I am doing as the District X Vice President and that
<br />
is attend Free Flight events.  I've been to Lost Hills, Otay Mesa as well
<br />
as Sal Taibi field in Perris CA. multiple times.  I have covered these
<br />
events in my magazine column.  I always enjoy the people I meet and the
<br />
insight I get into what it takes to have a contest winning model.  Second I
<br />
would make sure we have free flight modelers participating on and providing
<br />
input to our major committees so that their voices are heard.
<br />
<br />The roll of competition within the AMA is central.  Competition improves
<br />
the equipment and techniques we use in all facets of modeling.  As a
<br />
competitor myself I know the benefit of practicing and perfecting our
<br />
craft.  I has made me a much better modeler.
<br />
<br />AMA's involvement in FAI competitions is to provide a framework for team
<br />
selection, support our world championship teams and represent them at FAI
<br />
meetings.
<br />
<br />I am happy to take individual questions too.  I can be contacted at
<br />
ama.district10_at_gmail.com or 707-480-2053.  I have spent most of my life
<br />
modeling and believe that the AMA has lost its focus.  I think we need to
<br />
be more representative of our member's interests which are primarily in the
<br />
traditional modeling area.  If you agree please vote for me.
<br />
<br />Sincerely,
<br />
Lawrence Tougas
