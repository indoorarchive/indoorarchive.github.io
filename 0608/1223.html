Nope. I don't see any advantage in causing a quicker change over for low ceiling. I would think a lighter spring would be the way to go for low ceiling to delay the changeover as much as possible (without landing). I also think that a single climb would conserve more turns than going up and coming down and going up again but this is just a gut feeling not based on ever having much success with either of these plans.
<br />
<br />I wouldn't use a second spring for anything.

<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I'm reading comp challenged, but are you saying to configure it
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;such that he second spring is only active during the first part of the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;flight? Thereby, causing the the amount of time that the model is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;descending in the initial stage of the flight to decrease and then for
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the spring to some how deactivate? If that is right, then wouldn't
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that be more efficient than using a heaver spring the whole way
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;through because the change in pitch would be more gradual.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Also what are the thoughts of gradual pitch change verses sudden pitch change?

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; If the prop is running at it's most efficient pitch then having a higher or

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; still at the highest possible point in the flying site, AND that the low
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; pitch setting should be carefully adjusted for the best possible cruise.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Just for purposes of illustration let's say that this point is at an

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; altitude of 100 feet and that you have 1000 turns left at this point in your

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; flight. Let's also say that you started with 2500 turns. What's left for the

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 1500 initial turns are going to be much more than is needed to reach the

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; target altitude. The job of the VP is to force the prop to run at an

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; inefficient (higher) pitch in order to reduce the model's climb so that all

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; of the initial 1500 turns can be safely used. You also want the prop to run

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; as slowly as possible during this phase of the flight so it is desirable to

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; have the highest possible pitch at all points of the climb phase - keeping

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; It follows that there are 2 distinct parts of a flight using VP. The

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; that makes some indoor flights better than others. The ascending portion is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; controlled by how well the VP does it's job of power modulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; If the above statements are factual, then I'm led to the following

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; conclusion:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; One of the most critical attributes of a VP hub is that the spring is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; strong enough to give absolute low pitch at absolute maximum altitude.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; The downsides of having a spring strong enough to do this are:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 1. a strong spring is heavy and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 2. a strong spring is going to want to change pitch earlier than a weaker
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; spring. If the change is too early then RPM's go up and time is lost.

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; I don't really see a way that a second spring can be helpful. It seems that

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; make the adjustment of the hub even more complicated than it already is.

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; What you really need is a way to delay the change from high pitch as long as

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Last week spent a couple of days paddling on the lake Saimaa, and had good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; time to think and ponder model-related things. I started to wonder why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; some VP-hubs that I have seen show double springs to resist the pitch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; change. I also made up a hypothesis, which is as follows:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; An ideal spring should have a linear change of twist as the function of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; the torque, thus if the spring coefficient was right, it would result in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; constant power output independent of the prop turns. However, the prop
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; efficiency is not constant, but for a prop that is designed in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; mid-range of the pitch, the efficiency will decrease at higher pitch, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; then even though the input power to the prop was constant, the output was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; reduced at higher pitch. Thus a model with &quot;proper&quot; spring coefficient,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; and which was trimmed for level flight at mid-torque, would actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; _sink_ at higher torque. ( I suppose we have seen this, as some people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; report models sinking at the start of the flight when trimmed at low
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; sites?). One solution would be to reduce the high pitch setting, but the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; setting is probably highly sensitive, and to avoid climbing to the ceiling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; then one would also need to back-off some. So to make the high-pitch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; setting more flexible, one adds another spring that kicks in at high
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; torque, and reduces the amount of pitch at high torque. This way one can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; maintain positive climb even at the high TQ, and still be able to wind the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; motor to the max, without a need for backoff?
