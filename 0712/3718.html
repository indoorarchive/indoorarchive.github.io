&nbsp;&lt;&lt;Tsk tsk. I might get insulted of that. Please remember that it was 
<br />
my
<br />
first F1D, &gt;&gt;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
And please remember that it was necessary for you to ask the CG 
<br />
question twice to trigger any responses, two so far.  
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;I might get insulted&gt;   I was afraid that you would see it  as an 
<br />
insult instead of an ISSUE.  Perhaps many others here could have been 
<br />
more diplomatic, but they didn't answer.  So please consider all the 
<br />
below more &quot;strong medicine,&quot; not insults.  Unfortunately, everything 
<br />
in print seems more severe than the same words in person.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&lt;&lt;but after some flying I have noticed how overly-rugged it is. &gt;&gt;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
This is a important step, to notice that.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&lt;&lt;I just would not
<br />
want to spend months of struggling with findinf a proper CG location&lt;&lt;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Months of struggle with CG?   I'm sorry if that was necessary on your 
<br />
first model, but this is probably part of the bigger  issue I 
<br />
am &quot;insulting you&quot; about.   I think Mr. Bailey was likewise implying 
<br />
that being close to weight will begin to reduce the CG problem as 
<br />
being anything close to overwhelming (months of struggle.)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
BBailey wrote,
<br />
&lt;&lt;As you bring the weight down, the pitch inertia will also come down 
<br />
and will improve the stability as a result. This means you may then 
<br />
be able to move the CG back a little&gt;&gt;
<br />

<br />
The Big Square article, which you refer to, has complete component 
<br />
weights, down to the density of each spar, and I recall those 
<br />
published weights were WITH VP.  You've made nice looking F1Ms, which 
<br />
I remember seeing at West Baden 04.  F1ds are not rocket science!  I 
<br />
imagine the problems with anyone trying &quot;lightweight models&quot; should 
<br />
be in the handling of model parts, and launching, but not in the 
<br />
building, which ought to be a simpler matter of believing what is 
<br />
written.  It's all easier upon seeing one at a contest, and how they 
<br />
should handle.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&lt;&lt;Well yeah, quite a big margin though as my first attempt flies at 
<br />
100%,
<br />
and Hunt's model shows 75%. OK, I compromise, aiming at 80 to 85% on 
<br />
the
<br />
next one.&gt;&gt;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
So, the Big Square article recommended 75%, you set your current 
<br />
model at 100% or even behind TE IIRC, yet you lament that &quot;F1d plans 
<br />
fail to list CG location.&quot;   The Big Square has a relatively low tail 
<br />
volume (area of tail X distance from wing) which naturally goes 
<br />
together with *relatively* forward CG positions.  Some flyers today 
<br />
are running further back CG, but with big tails and long models, a 
<br />
few even near 50% wing area, 34&quot; long models. But in the case of Big 
<br />
Square it would be better to follow what a good designer directs than 
<br />
to be tempted by what others are currently doing with different 
<br />
designs, IMO.   BTW, current &quot;new&quot; 55 cm rules were a reflection of 
<br />
Mr. Hunt's first Big Square, and not vice versa, I am told by a 
<br />
couple authorities!  So it had better fly!
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt; Would like to have my next model into 1.2 grams,
<br />
and NOT make it then overweight by having to move the wing to and fro 
<br />
on&gt;&gt;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Moving two wingposts should not make model &quot;overweight.&quot;  We're 
<br />
talking two strong joints (top) and two weak joints (bottom.)  Maybe 
<br />
a .005 g  glue pick up, at worst.  I just don't like poking too many 
<br />
holes in motortube.  (Plugging the old ones is optional.)

<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Another trick that I have tried in order to have instant &quot;CG 
<br />
portability&quot; is to have several lengths of rear half tailbooms, all 
<br />
interchangeable, but built to different lengths, say one that makes a 
<br />
model  31&quot; one for 32&quot; , 33&quot;, whatever.  But it's not easy to end up 
<br />
with a series of rear half-booms having same weights, similar 
<br />
stiffness.  In general, interchangeability is great in theory, but 
<br />
can become its own kind of nightmare, especially at contests.  Props 
<br />
however should be interchangeable!
