My main thoughts when offering my ideas were that fliers new to F1D, but perhaps not indoor in General could benefit from a wood only kit as it would require little thought on their part, ie email xx kit producer and order an F1D wood kit.  You have basically let someone else make the call to Green-Man balsa and select the wood for you.  Also, I would assume kit suppliers would keep kits on hand, so no waiting for shipping from England, until stick ran out.  Also, as noted, a builder who bought the all inclusive kit might want to build more models, so needs wood, but not all of the templates, forms, etc.
<br />
<br />Good discussion and feedback in here.  It also seems that we may see a few kit suppliers come out of this thing.  F1D is advanced enough (compared to say, LPP) that having a one stop shop for almost all of the required materials and forms would be great.
<br />
<br />A thought for would be suppliers- If I were doing it, I don't think I would offer a kit with winder, you're meter, pitch gauge, etc.  Such a kit assumes a person who has little to no experience in indoor FF.  Is that the type of flier that would be initially interested in F1D, or are you more likely to sell kits to fliers with some tools and experience?  I actually don't know the answer, but would hate to see someone invest in winders and torque meters, etc, only to not move their product.
<br />
<br />I will continue watching the developing of F1D kit options as I am going to end up buying something.
<br />
<br />Final thought....Mike, you already offer the templates and prop blocks for F1D on your website.  If you put together a wood package, offered tailboom forms and thrust bearings, I think you would have a marketable product.  To keep things really straightforward, include a &quot;Suggested hardware&quot; section on your site that lists all the stuff needed to build F1D models.  The consumer could read, decide what he or she needed, and order.  
<br />
<br />My humble $.02.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Don.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The cost isn't in the materials so much. A lot of it is in the jigs and various bits needed to actually build one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, as Joshua and others point out, you could build with with nothing more than a razor blade, straight edge, glue and micrometer. But I wouldn't recommend that at all. You'll end up like me with parts that don't match - i.e. motor sticks that don't have a matching tailboom and tailbooms without matching motor sticks. I got tired of wasting money.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which is why I created the form set for myself. Now everything fits everything else every time. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So this is what I see:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) A wood kit only, with forms printed on paper. No prefabrication whatsoever. But I almost don't understand the point. E-mail Greenman Balsa a list of wood, download the plan. There is really no value added here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Optional form kit that includes the above mentioned form set (potentially with rib slicer upgrade). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) Wood kit with spars cut, ribs cut, all parts ready, enough for three plans. Would include all forms, plus rib slicer and possibly OS film and cautery. The rest of the recommended parts would be listed in the kit along with sources (i.e. Harlan tailboom form). A detailed build log would be posted showing how you'd build it. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) A complete kit where nothing is left to purchase. Complete tool set would arrive on your doorstep. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chris seemed to be advocating for #1, but was happy that #2 was available. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I thought #3 was a reasonable kit with some wiggle room as to what could be left out (i.e. Chris ordered #3, then loved it so much he just wanted it again but without a second rib slicer/form set). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I believe Joshua was advocating for #4, which could run well over $1000 depending on how crazy you wanted to get. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; i.e. Include winders/digital torque meter/box/balsa and rubber stripper/etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Regards.
