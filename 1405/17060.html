Hi Don.
<br />

<br />
The cost isn't in the materials so much. A lot of it is in the jigs and various bits needed to actually build one.
<br />

<br />
Yes, as Joshua and others point out, you could build with with nothing more than a razor blade, straight edge, glue and micrometer. But I wouldn't recommend that at all. You'll end up like me with parts that don't match - i.e. motor sticks that don't have a matching tailboom and tailbooms without matching motor sticks. I got tired of wasting money.
<br />

<br />
Which is why I created the form set for myself. Now everything fits everything else every time. 
<br />

<br />
So this is what I see:
<br />

<br />
1) A wood kit only, with forms printed on paper. No prefabrication whatsoever. But I almost don't understand the point. E-mail Greenman Balsa a list of wood, download the plan. There is really no value added here.
<br />

<br />
2) Optional form kit that includes the above mentioned form set (potentially with rib slicer upgrade). 
<br />

<br />
3) Wood kit with spars cut, ribs cut, all parts ready, enough for three plans. Would include all forms, plus rib slicer and possibly OS film and cautery. The rest of the recommended parts would be listed in the kit along with sources (i.e. Harlan tailboom form). A detailed build log would be posted showing how you'd build it. 
<br />

<br />
4) A complete kit where nothing is left to purchase. Complete tool set would arrive on your doorstep. 
<br />

<br />
Chris seemed to be advocating for #1, but was happy that #2 was available. 
<br />
I thought #3 was a reasonable kit with some wiggle room as to what could be left out (i.e. Chris ordered #3, then loved it so much he just wanted it again but without a second rib slicer/form set). 
<br />

<br />
I believe Joshua was advocating for #4, which could run well over $1000 depending on how crazy you wanted to get. 
<br />
i.e. Include winders/digital torque meter/box/balsa and rubber stripper/etc.
<br />

<br />
Regards.
<br />
Mike Kirda<br />
