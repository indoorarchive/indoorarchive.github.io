&nbsp;&quot;If you wanted everything in one box, we'd by talking probably $400-$500.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Probably so, Mike, unless a kit maker likes working for charity, as some kit makers in past have done.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Limited Supply Offer from &quot;Average  Kits, LLC!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I have 3 F1d kits for sale, for $495, straight from my model box. Customer's choice, either &quot;kit form&quot; or fully assembled.  Kit form means I remove the existing  covering and include plenty of sheet Y2K (2004 vintage) and also dissolve rib to spar joints--it will look like a kit at that point.   The AMA rules do specify that more than a few minutes &quot;covering effort&quot; should be exerted by the builder.  To my knowledge, no F1d kits exists, so we perhaps establish what &quot;average kit&quot; conceivably does mean.  A fully assembled F1d, however could be useful for learning to fly with little time to build, for copying your own assemblies, or just to play with and look at.  You can mix and match kit vs. assembled.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Features: 
<br />
&nbsp;--Variable pitch props, 17.6', 18.5&quot; and 19.2&quot;  
<br />
&nbsp;--Fully boroned motorsticks, tailbooms, wings 
<br />
&nbsp;--one boroned stab avail. Other stabs all balsa
<br />
&nbsp;--weights between 1.185g a 1.250 gram.
<br />
&nbsp;--Airline legal model box, extra $39 (can be seen in Ind_Const photo section).
<br />
&nbsp;--ongoing  phone support, at my discretion.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;S&amp;H TBD, depending on whether  kit  vs. assembled 
<br />
&nbsp;Sincerely,
<br />
&nbsp;'Littler F1diddler    
<br />
&nbsp;
