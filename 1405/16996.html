Several fliers have talked about kits for Indoor. Nothing has come of it so far, but it may.
<br />
Years ago, short kits were offered for one of Dr. Drela's glider designs for a limited time.
<br />
This is a model that might serve us here. 
<br />

<br />
So what would you want in an F1D kit? How complete? And how many should it make? One? Three?
<br />

<br />
I could see including stuff I make (prop block, rib slicer, template set) plus wood from Nick Aikman, but without including OS Film and the tools from Ray Harlan. But even at that, we are talking about $100 for materials alone. (And I should point out that this is with ZERO profit.) 
<br />

<br />
So any purchaser would need to understand that they would need another $100 from Ray minimum, more likely $200 to get a good balsa stripper and micrometer to really finish off their tool set. 
<br />

<br />
Should a low temp cautery be included? (These are usually only available by the dozen.)
<br />
I'm pretty sure that if we were to offer kits, we'd want to only offer one version of them. Too difficult to make several different versions. 
<br />

<br />
Regards.
<br />
