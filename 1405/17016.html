Just my input, from a bit of experience in having kitted the winder for a short time. No, or only minimal, prefabrication. Just assemblies which simply cannot be made without complex jigs or fixtures.  
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;If somebody wants to get into F1D, you have to assume a level of model building skill (and tool inventory) high enough not to require pre-assembled parts. The builder should be encouraged to build. You don't want F1D going the way of the outdoor classes, where the 1%er just writes a check for the latest Ukranian technology, and then goes flying. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;You supply:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;The plans, including drawings for any templates. Also suggestions for the traveling box. 
<br />
&nbsp;DETAILED instructions, as there doesn't seem to be much in the way of published up-to-date info, except online. Maybe include a copy of Ron's book, which is great except it shuts off before the films became common. The builder should be encouraged to build. You don't want F1D going the way of the outdoor classes, where the 1%er just writes a check for the latest Ukranian technology, and then goes flying. I know that if I'm not good enough to build one (and I'm not) I have no business messing around with those classes.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;My 2Â¢,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;a.
<br />
