Wow! As a dazzled  bystander, I'm amazed. Several hundred dollars for the material to build one F1D, and the covering is about half the cost? Twenty F1Ds weigh about an ounce, so 320 F1Ds would weigh about a pound. That works out to about $60k per pound for materials! 
<br />

<br />
I knew people would use the best available supplies to get maximum performance, but didn't expect it to be quite that expensive. I think EAA had/has an F1D on display in a clear case. There is so little there, it's hard to believe it can be that expensive to build.
<br />

<br />
I am in awe of people who spend that much, and devote so much time, to build these wraith-like machines they can only fly a few times a year in a very few locations. That means also spending the money to travel and stay at distant places to fly and compete. My hat's off to you guys! I can see why your group is such an exclusive one. I can't imagine these planes ever being flown by very many modelers. You are truly dedicated people in a very specialized event!
