I spoke with Dan and got some more info. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;- A 36&quot; 4-gore ball will be the same price as a 48&quot; ball.  These will be hand-made, so the majority of the cost is in the labor.  If we want to order 10,000 of them, we can start talking about tooling :)   
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;- Harlan's balloon weighs about 90gm with the harness, some tape patches, self-sealing valve, etc.  Dan estimates a 36&quot; balloon will be around 50gm.  So we are good on weight
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;- Dan says the balloon should lose about .24% - .5% per day, which means basically nothing.  It should last a 5 day contest with no problems.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;- We have the option of a self-sealing valve (like what the flat party store balloons have) or a 1/2&quot; spout.  Dan recommends the spout because it is much easier to deflate.  He says the spout will hold helium fine.  The edge tapes over to seal.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;- He can add some tabs with packing tape reinforcement as attachment points
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;- About 3-week lead time (emphasis on the &quot;about&quot;.  They are heading to the Knoll R/C event soon, and have other obligations to schedule around, too.  They have one guy who knows how to do the hand-made process.)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Dan was a little surprised that we were willing to pay that much for a hand-made balloon.  He asked if we had tried the large balloons from the party stores or clusters of smaller balloons.  I told him those options don't work for us.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;He also told me about an Indoor meet he went to.  They had both R/C and Rubber FF.  He wanted to fly both timeslots, so he added a rubber powered flapping mechanism for one of his blimps.  Nice!
<br />

&nbsp;I don't steer via helium balloon and am unlikely to try to second guess Ray Harlan. He may use 8 gores to get a smooth shape. One can make a lifting balloon of many shapes from only two gores but the external heat-sealed seams may cut or entangle your F1D. Turning the envelope inside-out will not be trivial.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;It is worth contacting the RC toy blimp folks and seeing what they can offer. Toy RC blimps might be less expensive but lower quality than Ray's specialty balloon.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Some &quot;Mylar&quot; blimps are (or at least were) made from 2 gores of heat sealed polypropylene sheet. One supplier for this polypropylene was in Italy but I do not have the contact information and this was in 2000. The outside was printed but whether the inside was treated to permit heat sealing is unknown to me.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;After retiring from the local chemical company (Eastman Chemical, 33+ years), I worked a little for a local, now-defunct start-up RC toy blimp company. I calculated and measured lift, tested motors, props, batteries, built prototypes, test flew competitors' toys, and generally played in the lab. &lt;Grin&gt; I was not an investor and our business plan, quality, finances, and execution were weak. This start-up lasted about a year.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;The sealing iron that I used a few times was a soldering iron with a rotating cylindrical tip (a router bearing).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My understanding is that Ray Harlan's balloons are heat sealed.  I cannot say that they have no glued seams at all.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;By the way, the Harlan Mylar 35&quot; balloon is made from 8 gores.
