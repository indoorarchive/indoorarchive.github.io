The voting on the indoor rules change proposals was one of the worst screwed up messes I've seen for awhile. Instead of board members going to the AMA website to see the proposals they were instructed to vote based on what was published in the Digest. As a result the only info they had was what was in the Digest and what Walt described to them over the phone. IFF 15-12 was not mentioned in the Digest so they didn't even know it existed. I don't know how Walt described it to them over the phone. As it turns out IFF 15-12 passed 7-4.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;One board member who is listed as voting in favor of IFF 15-12 says he voted against it. Since the whole process was done with phone calls there's no way to verify what really happened.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Don Slusarczyk's separate proposal to allow film on A6 wasn't mentioned in the Digest. That one passed unanimously which was a good thing IMHO but probably not representative of the way most board members felt.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;To make things worse there was an error in IFF 15-12. If any of the board members actually read the proposals they were misled by the statement in the proposal that current records would not be affected. I tried to get Greg Hahn to fix the proposal but he disappeared before doing so. Tony Stillman agrees that it is an error but he says the only way to fix it at this point is with a cross proposal.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;This process needs to change. The people who represent those of us involved in competition need to be active competitors and they need to be able to access the Web and they need to be reachable by email. It is after all the 21st century.
<br />
