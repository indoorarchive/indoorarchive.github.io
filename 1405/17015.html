Josh, no offense taken.  I was looking at the kit from the point of a consumer, and one who is okay with sourcing certain materials, and tools, and obtaining a plan himself.  For those looking at producing a kit, perhaps look at different levels.  There are some people who would be happy with some wood, boron, wire, and thrust bearings.  Others would probably like the full kit with all of the bells and whistles.
<br />
<br />As a consumer,  personally, I most likely would not purchase a full kit with all the bells and whistles, but if someone were to offer a one stop shop for F1D materials, I would be on that faster than you can say F1D.
<br />
<br />I don't know if I hinted to it before, but something like the old IMS kits (less plan and maybe less covering) for F1L, F1D, LPP, and EZB, that have been modernized in terms of materials (who uses 1/16 square spars for EZB anymore?) would be great offerings for those just getting into indoor.  I know when I started (which is kind of funny because with a whole one contest under my belt, I am still very much a beginner) one of the hardest parts was sourcing materials.  To those who are dedicated, its part of indoor aero-modeling.  For those who may be less dedicated but still want to fly, it would be really nice to order a box of wood for an F1L, EZB, F1D, etc, and have the wood of proper size and weight, the thrust bearing(s) and other little bits to build the plane. 
<br />
<br />Though that's just me.  I am sure if you asked 100 indoor enthusiasts about their wishes for an F1D kit, you may very well get 100 different answers.
<br />

Duco or Ambroid, doesn't really matter there. Both have bent on me. Duco does seem to grab the seams easier, but I'll use whichever is handy. (I've gotten really good at gluing seams this spring.)
<br />
I do apply Boron with Ambroid though - With Duco I had a lot more buckling. YMMV.
<br />
I also use the Harlan glue pot for pregluing the boron.
