<br />
really worthwhile?

<br /><br />No chance of a tropical storm here! Incredible pictures show luxury resort
<br />
complete with sandy beaches, palm trees and clear blue water... inside
<br />
enormous German hangar surrounded by snow
<br />
<br /><br />With sandy beaches, clear blue water and palm trees, this looks like a
<br />
spectacular and luxurious sun-kissed resort. 
<br />
<br />Holidaymakers can be seen relaxing in swimming shorts and bikinis. Even the
<br />
occasional flamingo can be spotted. 
<br />
<br />But not everything is as it seems at Tropical Islands .

<br />Tropical Islands is inside a hangar built originally to house airships
<br />
designed to haul long-distance cargo. And despite it looking like
<br />
temperatures are through the roof - outside the giant hanger it is actually
<br />
snowing. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />As these incredible pictures show, the resort contains a beach, a lagoon ,
<br />
water slide and adventure park. 
<br />
<br />Guests can enjoy numerous restaurants, evening shows and can also relax in a
<br />
sauna.

<br />
actual weather a far cry from the conditions inside
