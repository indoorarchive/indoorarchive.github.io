Marty,
<br />
I agree that these are two separate discussions. 
<br />
Most local clubs try to expose younger people to indoor free flight thru various programs including Science Olympiad, YMCA programs, community center programs (in hopes of being allowed to fly there on a regular basis), school programs, etc. We probably could do more. The problem seems to be that extremely few of those exposed to the hobby have any interest at all in pursuing it. I am in favor of some kind of a beginners event, but I don't think the lack of one is why we cannot attract newcomers.  A local club could easily have on open class &amp; a beginners/novice class, but where will the novices come from?

<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I've seen pages of discussion about the details of the A-6 rules, 
<br />
admittedly not an easy thing on which to get consensus. If people agree 
<br />
that A-6 is a class which is supposed to get beginners hooked on indoor 
<br />
FF competition, then why has there been only one comment about my post 
<br />
on having ONE two-division class where only beginners are allowed to 
<br />
compete for the trophy in the beginners division? It means an extra set 
<br />
of trophies, but c'mon guys! Focus! How can we bring newbies into 
<br />
trying indoor FF competition AND get them hooked????? I suggested we 
<br />
put out some candy (trophies!)
<br />
<br />I find the rules discussion interesting, but it has become a separate 
<br />
issue from getting and keeping newbies, and our hobby NEEDS to get and 
<br />
keep newbies if it is to survive. There has been some discussion of how 
<br />
to bring newbies into the hobby in the past, but IMHO we need a more 
<br />
robust 'Survival of the Hobby' thread separate from the A-6 rules 
<br />
thread. Or is this hobby actually another 'creative anachronism' like 
<br />
using Morse code on Ham Radio?
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
<br />Marty
<br />
<br />P.S. - I like Morse code, too.

Most teachers answer it emphatically:
&quot;Absolutely! YES!&quot;
