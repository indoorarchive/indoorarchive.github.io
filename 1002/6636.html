Go Mark, Go Mark, Go Mark, Go ! ! ! !

<br />
<br />I&#x2019;m with you.  I believe an A-6 beginner class and the Pennyplane Pro-AM
<br />
have more possibilities of bringing new folks into the hobby than anything
<br />
I&#x2019;ve heard of lately.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Speaking of Ham Radio and Morse.  There is no longer a Morse Code
<br />
requirement in Ham Radio.  When Ham Radio started the best communication
<br />
mode was Morse and the radios had condensers made with condenser paper.
<br />
Today Morse is only a part of Ham Radio and the capacitors made with Mylar
<br />
have replaced condensers.  
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Another thing that was suggested, I think it was by John Kagan, was
<br />
certificates for making certain times.  I always enjoyed the certificates I
<br />
received for working difficult to contact stations in Ham Radio.  I know if
<br />
there is a five minute certificate available when I get two minutes better I
<br />
will be tickled to get one.

<br />I've seen pages of discussion about the details of the A-6 rules,
<br />
admittedly not an easy thing on which to get consensus. If people agree
<br />
that A-6 is a class which is supposed to get beginners hooked on indoor
<br />
FF competition, then why has there been only one comment about my post
<br />
on having ONE two-division class where only beginners are allowed to
<br />
compete for the trophy in the beginners division? It means an extra set
<br />
of trophies, but c'mon guys! Focus! How can we bring newbies into
<br />
trying indoor FF competition AND get them hooked????? I suggested we
<br />
put out some candy (trophies!)
<br />
<br />I find the rules discussion interesting, but it has become a separate
<br />
issue from getting and keeping newbies, and our hobby NEEDS to get and
<br />
keep newbies if it is to survive. There has been some discussion of how
<br />
to bring newbies into the hobby in the past, but IMHO we need a more
<br />
robust 'Survival of the Hobby' thread separate from the A-6 rules
<br />
thread. Or is this hobby actually another 'creative anachronism' like
<br />
using Morse code on Ham Radio?
<br />
<br />Marty Alderman,
<br />
You touch on several of the complexities of what's going on, but the scene
<br />
is even more complex (some would say more hopeless) than that.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;If people agree
<br />
that A-6 is a class which is supposed to get beginners hooked on indoor&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Nope, people don't really agree about that, either. IN THE CONTEXT OF
<br />
existing competition, I fail to see how A6 is supposed to appeal to those
<br />
who do not already have access to 4 lb balsa and light C-paper, which is
<br />
reportedly no longer available. Of course, the reputation of A6 does attract
<br />
many to try it, but they quickly thereafter discover the reality. 
<br />
<br />Quote from Clarence Mather, &quot;I decided to to create a model that used
<br />
materials familiar to everyone and would be small, simple to build, and
<br />
sturdy enough to survive most of the banging around that would occur. NO
<br />
SPECIAL INDOOR MATERIALS WERE ALLOWED.&quot;&quot;
<br />
<br />(Caps mine. MB)
<br />
<br />Contrast the above with Gary Hodson's text about his ever-winning A6 &quot;Wart.&quot;
<br />
Quote: &quot;I find the stiffness rating of Tim Goldstein's Tru-Weight Indoor
<br />
Balsa to be particularly helpful in selecting wood for specific
<br />
applications. Light, stiff wood for the 1/16th&quot; wing &amp; stab keeps the
<br />
surfaces warp free &amp; allows more weight to be built in to the motor stick
<br />
where it is required for stiffness. Also, a stiff, light tail boom is
<br />
essential. Light weight prop blades are important, but their stiffness can
<br />
be lower. In order to build down to the 1.2 gram minimum weight, it is
<br />
important to have a reliable source of excellent wood.....The large
<br />
stand-off results in a lot of bending force so the motor stick needs to be
<br />
very stiff. I test my motor sticks for bending as described by Larry Coslick
<br />
in his EZB articles in INAV......Best time: 10 miniutes 19 sec. was made on
<br />
an 18&quot; loop of March 2002 Tan II rubber.....&quot;
<br />
<br />So there, Marty, is how state-of-the-art knowledge and materials are applied
<br />
to a so-called newcomers-attracting event. 
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;It means an extra set
<br />
of trophies, but c'mon guys! Focus! How can we bring newbies into
<br />
trying indoor FF competition AND get them hooked????? I suggested we
<br />
put out some candy (trophies!)&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Indoor contests are no longer trophy-centric, if they ever were. I can't
<br />
remember the last indoor contest where I saw a real trophy handed out to
<br />
anyone. Maybe at USIC, I forget. Rather, we compete for one thing--a TIME
<br />
designation sitting right after our name. We know whether that time is a
<br />
respectable time or not, and we know that other indoorists know whether it's
<br />
a respectable time or not. And that's about it! 
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, an easier &quot;sanctioned&quot; class should have merit, if only to see
<br />
if it helps the scene. If trophies are expected, then fine--there's another
<br />
chore for the CD to worry about. 
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt; How can we bring newbies into
<br />
trying indoor FF competition AND get them hooked????? I&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />The inherent fallacy in the above sentiment is that WE don't hook anyone.
<br />
Only the FLYING MODEL can hook someone. If that flying model is not itself
<br />
motivation to try to get better and better, then no trophy candy, no tooth
<br />
fairy is going to hook anyone. At least not in the context of COMPETITION.
<br />
<br />Please recall how in message 7072 Mr. Downer reminds us about the joy of the
<br />
&quot;DAMN IT FLIES&quot; stage. This joy ought to be promoted by local clubs. But the
<br />
existing infrastructue of national competition was forged by those who
<br />
wanted more than sport flying, so contest culture need not be changed to
<br />
accomodate sport/fun flying. We can accomodate it already! 
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, I am in favor of TRYING to create a newcomer event that
<br />
functions for newcomers. So as to not spoil the &quot;experts'&quot; fun, I will wait
<br />
until this whole rules thing blows over, then campaign my 1.8 gram , any
<br />
heavy-enough covering A6, called &quot;A6 Limited&quot; or maybe &quot;A6 Spirit.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;AMA A6,&quot; if it passes in present form, will have little to do with the
<br />
spirit that created it.
