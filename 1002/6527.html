Mark,
<br />
<br />I also qualify as one newcomer that would be affected by A6 rules.  I teach a high school engineering tech class in Ohio.  In the past we used A6 as our aerodynamics project.  Condenser paper was hard to come by and warped our structures.  We stopped doing the project out of frustration.  The next year I decided to heck with your rules, I'll make my own.  Plastic covering was OK, 50% stab area, 1.90 gram minimum w/o rubber, the rest unchanged.  It was a stunning success.  My students loved it and they learn alot.  The students went out and solicited pledges for time aloft and donated the money to a local aircraft museum.  We tried Limited Penny planes the next year (seniors) and that proved too technical and took too much teacher involvement (Warping prop blades).  You guys can discuss all you want, but we'll go back to my rules and just have our own contest.  Limited A6 as a separate category may make everyone happy.  It just might help some new kids enter your hobby.

<br />Gary,
<br />
In this case, I threw those ideas out there as linguini against a wall to see what sticks.  If it lacks any merit, it won't stick, I hope. 
<br />
<br />If we're going to label A6 as &quot;novice entry level&quot; then I'm happier to help and consider the preferences of those who are entry level.  I don't hear the newcomers complaining, &quot;We can't get 10 minutes like the experts do.&quot;  Rather, I hear them saying &quot;We stumble over the paper issue, but can work with plastic.&quot;  So, since there is a common, free supply of plastic that's as heavy (or heavier) as light C-paper, how would allowing *that* transform the class to something worse?  It's at least in the spirit of &quot;No special materials,&quot; which light C-paper may be classified, conceivably.  
<br />
<br />Please continue to stand for your beliefs, here, and everywhere. I could still flip-flop, just like John Kerry. :^))
