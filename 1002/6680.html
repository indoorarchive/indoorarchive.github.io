I might be wrong here, and if anyone knows first hand the specifics, I will stand corrected, but the &quot;original&quot; A6 event was conceived for Mather's club in the 70's and published in their newsletter, and first written in INAV in Jun-Jul 1978...  A few quotes from the article...
<br />
<br />&quot;It is ideal for those after-the-business-meeting activities of clubs&quot; 
<br />
&quot;a good one to use with groups of beginners if guidance is available&quot; 
<br />
&quot;We didn't intend for the model to be for the rank beginner but rather for the club as a group activity&quot;
<br />
<br />Interestingly enough, the original rules had tissue covering specified, and the prop shaft needed to be 1/32&quot; wire, along with the bearing being required to be 1/16&quot; aluminum tubing...  with no mention of weight limits...
<br />
<br />It was something for the &quot;experts&quot; to have fun with in a small space, as well as something to teach others some of the elements of indoor...  It basically disappeared for 20 years, and was revived a while back with modified rules as a competitive event...  
<br />
<br />A6 has evolved into an event held in a 100' site, during the largest indoor contest of the year...  The current event is -not- a beginners event, but is an excellent event for indoor...  It amazes me that Sova, Gowen, Emil, Tem and Gary can do the times that the consistantly do...  If someone can only make a 1.5g or 2g model, who cares...?  as long as they are having fun (oh, -that's- what it is about...) all is well...  I see at USIC year after year guys having a blast doing less than half the time of the winning times...  
<br />
<br />All this &quot;let's make an event for beginners&quot; rehoretic seems to get old faster each time...  Just have events... The &quot;experts&quot; will win (guess that is why they are experts... lol...) and hopefully the beginners will have fun and be hooked like I was...  Weight limits  don't seem to help anything, and for the most part make the events -harder-...  I flew F1L and EZB the first few years...  now I only fly EZB (finally getting into the 30 minute EZB club this summer) but if they put a weight limit on that, I'd probably find another class to work on...
<br />
<br />If it isn't fun, then just find something else to do...
