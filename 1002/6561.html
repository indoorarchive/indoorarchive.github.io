The suggestions include (but are not limited to):
<br />
increase the minimum weight but require paper covering
<br />
increase the minimum weight &amp; allow plastic covering
<br />
allow any plastic covering
<br />
allow only heavy plastic covering
<br />
don't change anything
<br />
add a maximum stab area
<br />
specify specific span &amp; cord dimensions I.E. create a &quot;one design&quot; event
<br />
allow formed props
<br />
various restrictions/interpretations concerning other hi tech. materials, torque burners, plastic tubes on motors, o-rings, variable pitch props, etc.  
<br />
<br />We have an event that has been popular for approximately 10 years without any significant rules changes. It is one of the most participated in events at the USIC &amp; the Kibbie Dome, and an annual world wide postal contest. By indoor free flight standards, it is a relatively simple event &amp; paper covering is integral to the original concept as are all the other parts of the rules.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
A6 requires making a prop, a wire (or other type) prop bearing, obtaining some moderately light wood, light paper covering &amp; some experience in building.  
<br />
If beginners find A6 too difficult we need another event more suited to their skill level.
<br />
I don't accept that paper is any more difficult to obtain or difficult to work with than film is to obtain &amp; work with. It just takes different techniques. If it were so difficult why has the event been so popular? Many of the people complaining about paper covering are very accomplished indoor fliers. Give me a break!
<br />
There are many film covered indoor events to choose from. There are also many examples of indoor events that have been dramatically changed (both intentionally &amp; unintentionally) as a result of rules changes, such as EZB, AROG &amp; Intermediate Stick (formerly paper stick).
<br />
<br />Please leave us one paper covered indoor duration event for those of us that find that form of modeling appealing.

I must say this is disappointing. Canâ€™t you guys just compromise on the covering material clause? 90% of the folks that have given me feedback are in favor of dumping the paper rule.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
We are too small a community to split hairs like this. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Do mind about the 50% stab area rule? Gowen has compromised on that one.

<br /><br />The only rules that I would support are rules that would leave A6 as it has been flown in the annual postal contest &amp; at the USIC &amp; Kbbie Dome for approximately the last 10 years. I am also speaking for Tem Johnson &amp; Emil Schutzel who do not have internet access.
<br />
<br />By the way, Emil has been to the Kibbie Dome for many years &amp; does not believe a 12 minute A6 flight occured.

<br />&nbsp;I hear you loud and clear. This might be too much revolution (vs. evolution) however. And it would obsolete hundreds of A-6s.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />A tough decision.

<br /><br /><br />&quot;Last Sunday Lou showed us his A-6 that won at Kibbie Dome with a 12 minute 
<br />
flight. He is figuring out ways to make it better.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br /><br />Gary, I believe a bunch of us would like to hear the details of a 12 minute A-6 flight, including information on the model itself, rubber used, turns, etc. I think prop pitch is a main factor, BTW. 45%? More? Less? 
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br /><br />In the meantime, after thinking it over, I believe a minimum weight of 1.5 grams would work well with this event. It's still light, but not out of reach of first time indoor builders. And I would specify only Japanese tissue be used for covering. Don, I hope you will give these suggestions due consideration.
