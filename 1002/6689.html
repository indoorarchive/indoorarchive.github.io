<br /><br />Gary,
<br />
I am referring to the overall intent and purpose explained by C.Mather, &quot;I decided to create a model that used materials
<br />
familiar to everyone and would be small, simple to build, and sturdy enough to survive most of the banging around that would occur. No special indoor materials were allowed.&quot;
<br />
<br />So if a rule is going to be changed, the above should indicate the direction to change it--toward its target audience--not in the direction of indoor excellence, IMO.  
<br />
<br />Obviously modern A6 is what it is, and got there for certain reasons. Not spoiling anyone's preference--support the AMA proposal if you like it. Just hoping there's also (eventual) room for an A6-based model that tries to recover the above intent of extreme accessibility.
<br />
<br />Other poster,
<br />
&lt;&lt;.All this &quot;let's make an event for beginners&quot; rehoretic seems to get old faster each time... If someone can only make a 1.5g or
<br />
2g model, who cares...?   &gt;&gt;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Often those who build do care, starting with the hope to build something &quot;in the ballpark&quot;, even though we default to saying &quot;just having some fun&quot; when things don't work. (Message 7013 reminder--things became FUN for this group after they were able to build to loosened parameters--plastic and higher weight, yet still parameters.) I suppose we could  promote &quot;Starting F1d&quot; by telling anyone to just build a 3 gram F1d--but no one would do that.  We could even fly an F1L as in F1d contest (fits size rules), but how come no one does that?  Because it's normal at any level to want to FEEL LIKE your models are conceivably &quot;in the game,&quot; not too inferior before you even start to wind the motor.  (Of course we thereafter learn our inexperience may be a bigger handicap than an inferior model.)
<br />
JMO,

<br />
<br /><br />From message 7013,
<br />
&lt;&lt; In the past we used A6 as our
<br />
aerodynamics project. Condenser paper was hard to come by and warped our
<br />
structures. We stopped doing the project out of frustration. The next year I
<br />
decided to heck with your rules, I'll make my own. Plastic covering was OK, 50%
<br />
stab area, 1.90 gram minimum w/o rubber, the rest unchanged. It was a stunning
<br />
success. My students loved it and they learn alot. The students went out and
<br />
solicited pledges for time aloft and donated the money to a local aircraft
<br />
museum. We tried Limited Penny planes the next year (seniors) and that proved
<br />
too technical and took too much teacher involvement (Warping prop blades). You
<br />
guys can discuss all you want, but we'll go back to my rules and just have our
<br />
own contest. Limited A6 as a separate category may make everyone happy. It
<br />
just might help some new kids enter your hobby.
<br />
