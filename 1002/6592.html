RReyno,
<br />
I will try to answer your question as best as I can. For the most part, I would agree with your comments, if we were designing a new event. 
<br />
My comments pertain to A6 as it exists today &amp; has for approximately the last 10 years. 
<br />
A6 isn't the prefect beginners event, entry level duration event or serious duration event. Then again, there isn't any perfect event.  
<br />
It isn't intended to teach every skill needed to move on to more advanced classes. 
<br />
If it frustrates you to have warped surfaces why not employ one of the many easy techniques to avoid warping? 
<br />
A6 seems to have filled a niche in the indoor event spectrum quite well. Reason enough to leave it alone. 
<br />
The simple answer to why some of us don't want to change A6 is because we want to have one indoor duration event that is based on paper covering. Those that like film have many to choose from. We don't.
<br />
I would ask those that want to change it, how they would feel if an event they really liked was about to be changed in a way they objected to?
<br />

<br />
<br />Gary, I see your point but isn't it logical that if A6 is intended for entry level flyers as a training ground so that they can move on to the more &quot;advanced&quot; classes then wouldn't they gain from using the same film that they would use in those events? Using condenser paper requires the entry level flyer to gain practiced technique with a covering that they wouldn't use again in any other class.
<br />
<br />CP is really unpredictable if exposed to a different humidity than what it was applied in. The resultant warping of carefully built flying surfaces isn't bound to keep most beginners interested in indoor flying. Yes, I know it's possible to avoid this but why not promote indoor flying without the frustration of condenser paper?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The weight savings resulting from light weight film will be put to use by experienced fliers. I believe the result will be designs that are even more difficult for inexperienced fliers to compete with. In addition, there is a possibility the the smooth film surface will have an aerodynamic (less drag) advantage over paper which is usually winkled or rendered irregular by shrinking &amp; ironing over a towel. If this proves to be the case paper covered models will be rendered obsolete. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps you think I am trying to protect my &quot;turf&quot;. I agree in the sense that I was attracted to A6 because I really liked the idea of a simple paper covered model &amp; I still do. If I have become good at flying A6, it is because I worked at it &amp; really enjoy the event as it has been flown for approximately 10 years. I have begged &amp; pleaded with you all to not change the only actively participated in event of this type &amp; forever change it.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I really agree with Don S. As long as thereâ€™s a reasonable weight minimum there is no danger of A-6 going the way of EZB.
