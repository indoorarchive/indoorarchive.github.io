I've never experienced the dirty looks and whispers thing. What I find to be the more usual case is that someone who is doing 2 or 3 minutes in A6 to my 5 or 6 wants to know what they have to do to achieve that level of performance. And then I tell them.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I have always noticed with any beginner event, is that sooner than later, some non beginner gets it in their head how easy it would be too win in that beginner class, and so they do, I am sure at first much to the consternation of many involved. People see this and think to themselves...Oh well that first guy survived the dirty looks and whispers behind his back, the seed is planted and next competition, another experienced competitive flier thinks what the heck, I think Ill try the beginner class too, looks easy, I think I can win it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so on and so forth, and within a half a dozen or so competitions, the so called beginner class is filled with 'so called' beginners and that's that, we have another highly competitive class to choose from. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't only happening in free flight, it happens in any sort of organized activity where they compete, and try to encourage newcomers by introducing 'new comer' classes, with no restrictions on joining.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems the simplest solution is to outlaw competitive fliers from competing in beginner classes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginners compete against beginners, been in three-four competitions you are no longer a beginner.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Likely A-6 is not the class for this anymore, it is highly specialized and competitive, the 1.25 gram minimum weight is ridiculous, that is 4 lb wood, what beginner can work with 4lb wood, let alone find a piece of 4lb wood.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Indoor competitive free flight has become very scary place for newcomers, I know I wouldn't think twice about trying to compete in A-6, and it seems to me it is likely the easiest event going, likely filled with experienced, highly competitive fliers.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps they need another beginner event, reserved exclusively for beginners.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how it is seen through this rank newbs eyes anyways.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;-G.
