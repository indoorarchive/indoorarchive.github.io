Don, 
<br />
If there is a need for a &quot;beginner's&quot; event, then I think the best approach would be to spend some time discussing what that the goal of the event would be &amp; trying to come to a consensus on the rules for the event. As opposed to trying to modify A6 into beginner's event. First we might want to have some agreement on just what a beginner is. Is it only kids or does it include adults that have never flown free flight before or some other description? Would the event be for people who have already had some building experience such as a delta dart? Presumably, experienced fliers will assist the beginners. Are experienced fliers allowed to participate in the event or not? Should the model be simple enough to build in one session or can it be more sophisticated? 
<br />
I would be glad to participate is such a discussion.
<br />
Don, the 10 minute flights you refer to are only done in category 4 sites such as USIC &amp; Kibbie Dome. In a typical school gymnasium (where most beginners begin) with a cluttered open girder ceiling 3 minutes is much more common &amp; even relatively new people can come close to the more experienced fliers times.

<br />Ric,
<br />
<br />Your practical experience to me trumps everything else. If A-6 is indeed 
<br />
becoming an AMA event only for beginners then this is the type of info 
<br />
that needs to be taken into account and rules adopted to the reality of 
<br />
what happens when beginners build the model. If A-6 is becoming an AMA 
<br />
event simply to unify the rules or to create a new record class then it 
<br />
really means nothing to beginners as A-6 in its present form is not 
<br />
exactly a beginners event. 10 minutes with a 1.2 gram 30 sq inch model 
<br />
is not exactly for beginners. 
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I also qualify as one newcomer that would be affected by A6 rules. I teach a high school engineering tech class in Ohio. In the past we used A6 as our aerodynamics project. Condenser paper was hard to come by and warped our structures. We stopped doing the project out of frustration. The next year I decided to heck with your rules, I'll make my own. Plastic covering was OK, 50% stab area, 1.90 gram minimum w/o rubber, the rest unchanged. It was a stunning success. My students loved it and they learn alot. The students went out and solicited pledges for time aloft and donated the money to a local aircraft museum. We tried Limited Penny planes the next year (seniors) and that proved too technical and took too much teacher involvement (Warping prop blades). You guys can discuss all you want, but we'll go back to my rules and just have our own contest. Limited A6 as a separate category may make everyone happy. It just might help some new kids enter your hobby. &gt;
