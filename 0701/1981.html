I don't know whether my solution will work for you, but here's how I 
<br />
solved the problem.  
<br />
<br />I started by coaching single schools like you, heck, Brett Sanborn 
<br />
who now flys F1Ds so well was in my FIRST group coaching session.  
<br />
But I became frustrated because of the large number of students I saw 
<br />
at competitions who had problems with just the basics of these 
<br />
events.  
<br />
<br />I started expanding by telling the schools I coached that my 
<br />
continued support depended on running at least SOME multi-school 
<br />
events.  That helped some.
<br />
<br />Next, I became involved with the local and state SO organization as 
<br />
an event supervisor (they are ALWAYS looking for good help).  There I 
<br />
had the opportunity to present Wright Stuff at coaches clinics.  The 
<br />
coaches typically expected a discussion of the rules and event 
<br />
procedures.  I'd cover that in 5-10 minutes, emphasizing having THEM 
<br />
read the rules.  Then I spent the rest of my time telling them how to 
<br />
make a plane FLY.  I'd finish the presentation by offering to come to 
<br />
THEIR school and spend a day coaching IF they opened up the session 
<br />
to other schools in their region.  
<br />
<br />This has been very successful.  If the coach isn't interested in 
<br />
helping others, they don't invite me.  But I guess my starting 
<br />
sessions were good enough that I've got plenty of invites, more every 
<br />
year as my name gets around.  So far this year I've run three half 
<br />
day to full day events with around 30 schools participating.  I have 
<br />
one each weekend from now till the end of Feb and expect to see at 
<br />
least another 40+ schools.
<br />
<br />Now, I know not everyone is interested in spending as much time as I 
<br />
do, but I think the problem of a school trying to 'hoard' knowledge 
<br />
(which is all available somewhere on the internet anyway) can be 
<br />
addressed even with more limited efforts.  Just be clear up front, 
<br />
the help you provide is not just for a limited few, your you'll find 
<br />
other eager takers.

limited

one 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; high school gym to fly and pass along my many years of experience.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At first the coach for the local gym we were using showed soem

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; displeasure in me bringing the so called competetion to the gym but

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never said anything. He would take his students off to the side and

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talk quietly about flying and trimmimg.  Understand this coach also 
</em><br />
a 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parent gained all his knowledge from me.  I let it go. This weekend

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after having a local middle school coach and students come to the

gym 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to experience BLG again I saw the same attitude until the students

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; left then all was good again.   I recieved a phone call later in

the 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; day from the coach/parent stating because of liabilty only the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; students going to the high school in question could use the gym as 
</em><br />
a 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; test facility.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  My goal is to not only teach young people the joys of indoor free

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flight and experience the feeling of a sucessful flight but to
