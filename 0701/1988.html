<br />
Larry,
<br />
<br />Please don't give up&#x2026;the students, the event and the indoor
<br />
hobby&#x2026;all need you!!! Without our mentor (Mark Schaefer) our team
<br />
would be lost&#x2026;we never could have made it this far without him!!!!
<br />
Both WS and BLG are hard events&#x2026;in which a mentor is worth his
<br />
weight in gold!!!!
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Despite the frustration&#x2026;try to keep in mind that for &quot;some&quot;
<br />
this isn't just a hobby &#x2026;it's a lot like a sport. The
<br />
coaches, the parents and the student's goal are to be number
<br />
one&#x2026;so &quot;the whole team&quot; can win &quot;the whole contest&quot;
<br />
in the end. There is a lot of pressure to make the score. Some people
<br />
take this to extreme&#x2026;just like those crazy sport fanatics&#x2026;.and I
<br />
think in this case you have been dealing with one parent/coach of this
<br />
type.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I believe that being number one isn't everything&#x2026;its nice of
<br />
course&#x2026;but you need to earn it. If there isn't any
<br />
competition&#x2026;it's not a sweet victory. Last year Kelsey (my
<br />
daughter) competed most of the year ahead of others. She was excited
<br />
when others started progressing&#x2026;and she also pushed for the others
<br />
to get better. She not only helped some of the other competitors learn
<br />
how to trim but she even helped some of them fix their gliders when they
<br />
broke. I believe as the student progresses they tend to feel a comradery
<br />
with the other teams just as the indoor hobbyist do with each other. I
<br />
was just amazed at the state contest last year&#x2026;when I saw first
<br />
hand&#x2026;how much the different WS and BLG &quot;flying&quot; teams
<br />
supported one another&#x2026;not only in cheering each other on &#x2026;but
<br />
with loaning winders, rubber, balloons and glue. I was extremely proud
<br />
of the good sportsmanship I saw between these teams!
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Remember&#x2026;not all of us in Science Olympiad are schmucks. I see both
<br />
the value and potential in BLG and WS&#x2026;and I think all the kids
<br />
deserve the help and chance to prosper!!!!! As a mother whose kids
<br />
compete in this event&#x2026;I wouldn't be running a yahoo group to
<br />
help other students and coaches learn the BLG&#x2026;if I didn't
<br />
believe this! Diplomacy would be great option! However, if that
<br />
doesn't work&#x2026;in my opinion Larry&#x2026;help those who
<br />
&quot;want&quot; to be helped&#x2026;and don't worry about the others!
<br />
It's their loss!
<br />

<br />
<br /><br /><br />BTW&#x2026;from what I have witnessed and from the reports I have
<br />
heard&#x2026;the BLG has become quite the spectator sport. My hope is that
<br />
this brings on a new &quot;interest&quot; in indoor flying.
