<br />
Dave,
<br />
<br />It sure is great to hear you talk about the Clems. I grew up in Dallas and
<br />
flew with Jim and Mike often. I was about 5 years younger than Mike. Later
<br />
when Mike was out of flying Jim and I kept flying together. He taught me
<br />
most of what I know about indoor and I still fly his great designs. When I
<br />
learned of Jim's death in '02 I built his Ministick design that evening.
<br />
What a great man.
<br />
<br />Please give me regards to Fran and Mike. I assume Mike is still involved
<br />
with the Clem engine business? He may not remember me but I know Fran will.
<br />
I never met Jimmy but I'm sure you knew him.
<br />
<br />Prod Mike about returning to the indoor NATS. It sure would be great to see
<br />
him flying again. He was great flyer.
<br />
<br />--Don DeLoach

<br />
<br />P.S. I also knew your Dad. Great guy. I was just reading one of his old NFFS
<br />
Digest articles on torque meters.

Subject: Re: [Indoor_Construction] Science Olympiad Issues
<br />
<br />OK.. knowing very little about Science Olympiad, I
<br />
still feel compelled to weigh in on this.. 
<br />
<br />Having grown up in this hobby and competing at all
<br />
levels of this and other hobbies as a kid(pinewood
<br />
derby, kite flying, etc) I can say without question
<br />
that I have a desire to bring my very best to each and
<br />
every competition. While it is a hobby and it is
<br />
certainly fun, I compete to WIN. However, the greatest
<br />
gift ANY of these competitions gave me is a series of
<br />
life long friendships. 
<br />
<br />Some 30 years ago another Junior flyer, Mike Clem, and
<br />
I were primary competitors at most of the national
<br />
competitions... we consistantly designed, built, and
<br />
trimmed to &quot;one up&quot; the other. We each wanted to win,
<br />
but we ALSO wanted the other to do their very best as
<br />
well.. It is a hollow victory indeed when your
<br />
competitors midair or broken model prevents them for
<br />
pushing you to do YOUR best. 
<br />
<br />Mike and I would generally set our tables up next to
<br />
each other at meets, review our latest &quot;innovations&quot;
<br />
on new models, stand side-by-side praticing winding
<br />
techniques taught to us by one of the elder statesmen,
<br />
and even encourage each other to field fix that broken
<br />
model and get another flight in before giving up.
<br />
<br />I am happy to say that 30 years later, I spent this
<br />
Christmas Holiday with the Clem family and that
<br />
friendship has transcended the hobby.
<br />
<br />The issue you describe seems to me to speak to an
<br />
&quot;overzealous parent&quot; issue. I believe the parents need
<br />
to be reminded that Johnny is learning a sad lesson
<br />
indeed when his coach is teaching him that hoarding
<br />
knowledge, locking others out of practice sites,  and
<br />
win at the cost of others is the motto. 
<br />
<br />Quite frankly.. I took up indoor AFTER competeing in
<br />
Control Line speed for a year. My last competition was
<br />
the 75 Nats when I saw a parent yelling at both his
<br />
kid and the parent of a competitor!..Even as a 10 year
<br />
old at the time, I was so distrubed by this behavior,
<br />
I didn't want to continue. I found such a collegial
<br />
atmosphere in the Indoor scene that it encouraged me
<br />
to continue in the hobby.
<br />
<br />I suppose all of this is to say that even though I
<br />
believe it is a parents job to teach the lessons of
<br />
good sportsmanship... sometimes the Mentor is going to
<br />
have to reinforce the lesson!
<br />
<br />just my 2 cents
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; students for the up and

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coming Regionals.  Anybody else having these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; negative responses to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mentoring?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; First I have been mentoring 2 local high schools and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3 middle schools 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in our county for 8 years.   I have seen alot of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; improvmwnt and some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rebnewed and growing interest in model aviation. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because of limited 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use of local gyms I have students from different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; schools come to one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; high school gym to fly and pass along my many years
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of experience.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At first the coach for the local gym we were using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; showed soem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; displeasure in me bringing the so called competetion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the gym but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never said anything. He would take his students off
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the side and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talk quietly about flying and trimmimg.  Understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this coach also a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parent gained all his knowledge from me.  I let it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; go. This weekend 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after having a local middle school coach and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; students come to the gym 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to experience BLG again I saw the same attitude
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; until the students 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; left then all was good again.   I recieved a phone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; call later in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; day from the coach/parent stating because of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; liabilty only the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; students going to the high school in question could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use the gym as a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; test facility.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  My goal is to not only teach young people the joys
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of indoor free 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flight and experience the feeling of a sucessful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flight but to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hopefully bring new blood into out beloved hobby.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Im done    Just food for thought.   Larry Norvall 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Woodbridge,CA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Oh on a side note  this BLG is a very cool event 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The middle school 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kids are jazzed and doing about 40 seconds in a 25
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; foot gym.   
</em><br />
