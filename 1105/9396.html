<br />
To all,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
This A6 discussion is both enlightening and challenging.  given a set  of 
<br />
rules, what can we do to push the limits and be within the rules?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Just an outside pragmatic opinion...I like indoor, but there is a problem  
<br />
with killing the goose that lays the golden egg.  Indoor flyers are to be  
<br />
admired.  My recent acquaintance with Kang Lee, who has jumped into indoor  
<br />
with both feet, I am in awe of.  He has the magic decoder solution and  skill 
<br />
to be a force in indoor, but conversations of rules always bug me.   If you 
<br />
count belly buttons of who are the guys who &quot;fly indoor&quot; competitively  and 
<br />
then those who say we need entry level events, and then say &quot;competition is 
<br />
&nbsp;the name of the game&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
This is a hard thing to reconcile.  At the top, there are a few who  are 
<br />
competing against each other and frequent this board.  On the other  hand..if 
<br />
they are happy with competing amongst themselves, so be it.  We  admire the 
<br />
accomplishments of the Stan Buddenbohms and John Kagans,  but is there 
<br />
desire to win over others or find some other folks that  could be a challenge too?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;IF&quot; the effort of the mainstream indoor flyers is to maintain the status  
<br />
quo and challenge each other until they die out, then forget about anyone 
<br />
else  who could get inspired by flying indoor.  There is a fine line in  this. 
<br />
&nbsp;Do the current &quot;guns&quot; of indoor want to promote the sport or do  they want 
<br />
only to promote their own competitive interest? Where do their  intentions 
<br />
lie?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I agree when I see the AMA A6 rules set that opens the door to really  
<br />
pushing the envelope, but back up a few feet and see how it benefits the  
<br />
activity.  Is it meant to get more involvement or to challenge the existing  
<br />
indoor flyers to outpace each other?  My personal thought was it was  intended to 
<br />
put forth a simple indoor event, but it seems to be growing  wings..so to 
<br />
speak.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Here's what I have gleaned from the AMA rules book....
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Indoor  Events…Evolution…. 
<br />
First there was: 
<br />
AMA Intermediate Stick…100in-2…called paper  stick 
<br />
AMA HL Stick…microfilm and all that…go for it 
<br />
Cabin…just for a change of pace 
<br />
ROG’s…same thing… just for a change of pace 
<br />
Ornithopter, helocopter, autogyro…more changes of  pace 
<br />
Interest waned…let’s think of an “entry level” event to generate interest 
<br />
&nbsp;again… 
<br />
EZB…what a good idea! 
<br />
EZB…crap…it went the way of the “pro’s”  Why wasn’t it “EZB” and then “
<br />
UNLIMITED  B”?? 
<br />
F1L…FAI solution to EZB…weight limits 
<br />
Pennyplane…What a great idea!…oops…rules went the way of  the pro’s 
<br />
Limited Penny…to throttle the outcome of Penny 
<br />
Bostonian…fun event to counter cabin 
<br />
Intent of Rule. This is an event to promote indoor flying of realistic  
<br />
propeller-driven, rubber-powered models of a size and complexity which are  
<br />
suitable for small buildings and limited skills. It also allows fanciful  
<br />
designs, for which no full-size counterpart exists, to be  flown. 
<br />
Scale: 
<br />
Power/P-nut/NoCal/P-24, etc gives us something else to fly  indoors 
<br />
Scale Models: 
<br />
23. Kit/Plan Scale.  
<br />
The intent of this  event is to foster flying of Free Flight Scale 
<br />
rubber-powered Indoor models by  providing an event which requires a minimum of 
<br />
research, documentation and  design and offers a maximum of flying. A secondary 
<br />
objective is the  encouragement of kitting and publication of good designs 
<br />
by requiring that the  models flown are built up and finished according to 
<br />
the designs used, so that  the better designs will be recognized by their 
<br />
success in  contests. 
<br />
24. Mini-Stick.  
<br />
24.1. The intent of this proposal is  to make Mini-Stick an official event 
<br />
to allow including the event in AMA  contests, to increase participation, 
<br />
and  to allow records to be more easily kept. 
<br />
26. A-6. For event (222 )  
<br />
26.1. General. Except for the  specific rules which apply directly to A-6, 
<br />
the rules for Free Flight Indoor  Rubber, Hand Launched Stick model shall 
<br />
apply. 
<br />
Maybe the approach is bass  ackwards….an entry level event and THEN the 
<br />
challenge event as the outcome of  the entry level. A-6 and &quot;THEN A-6 
<br />
UNLIMITED?&quot; 
<br />
Well guys, where do you want the  hammer to fall?  A rules change isn't 
<br />
that hard to come  by.

<br /><br />Usually I understand the intention of a rule, but am willing to  reject the 
<br />
intention if the *wording* indicates something else.  However,  I have no 
<br />
idea what dear AMA is trying to say or mean here.  Anyone?

<br />Free Flight Indoor Rubber
<br />
2. General
<br />
&quot;A powered model of  the indoor type shall be so designed that it can only 
<br />
be properly flown  indoors.&quot;
<br />
<br />I once flew a Manhattan Cabin outdoors in nice evening air,  without 
<br />
damage, and concluded that at least LPP, Bostonian, scale, etc. could  also be 
<br />
flown outdoors. So what do they mean by &quot;can only be properly&quot; ?
