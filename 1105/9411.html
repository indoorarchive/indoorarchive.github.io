<br />
For the record, here follows the exact text of my final A-6 rules set that
<br />
was voted down in favor of the &quot;informal&quot; A-6 rules cross proposal.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I stand by my assertion that the ICB screwed up royally by voting these down
<br />
in favor of the sloppy and loopholed &quot;informal&quot; rules. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I hope I'm wrong but I forsee A-6 biplanes with VP and hollow motor sticks
<br />
built with 3.2# wood. At that moment another entry-level event will bite the
<br />
dust.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />DD
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />General. Except for the specific rules which apply directly to A-6, the
<br />
rules for Free Flight Indoor Rubber, Hand-Launched Stick Model, shall apply.
<br />
<br /><br />A-6 Characteristics. 
<br />
<br />1. The A-6 model shall be a rubber-powered monoplane covered with paper
<br />
(tissue paper, Gampi, or condenser paper) only.
<br />
<br />2. The maximum projected wing area is 30 square inches. For ease of
<br />
processing, burden of proof (in the form of an accurate, dimensioned
<br />
drawing) lies with the contestant.
<br />
<br />3. Stabilizer area shall not exceed 50 percent of the projected wing area.
<br />
For ease of processing, burden of proof (in the form of an accurate,
<br />
dimensioned drawing) lies with the contestant.
<br />
<br />4. All wing and stabilizer outlines shall be constructed entirely from 1/16&quot;
<br />
square wood with corners left square/unsanded. 
<br />
<br />5. Cambered ribs are acceptable but must be cut from sheet balsa no thinner
<br />
than 1/32&quot;. Minimum rib depth is 1/16&quot;.
<br />
<br />6. The motor stick shall be made from solid wood only (no rolled tubes). It
<br />
shall be 6&quot; long maximum (measured from the front thrust bearing face to the
<br />
front of the rear hook).
<br />
<br />7. The tail boom shall me made from solid wood only (no rolled tubes). It
<br />
shall either be an extension of the motor stick or a separate piece of solid
<br />
wood. It is permissible to use splints of wood less than 3/8-inch (0.953
<br />
centimeters) long, attached directly to the original wood, to repair
<br />
structural damage to the tail boom and/or motor stick. 
<br />
<br />8. There are no restrictions on model length. 
<br />
<br />9. Minimum weight of model without rubber: 1.2 grams. 
<br />
<br />10. Wing posts 1/16&quot; square minimum solid wood (ends may be rounded for
<br />
inserting into paper tubes).
<br />
<br />11. There shall be no bracing on the model except that which consists
<br />
entirely of solid wood. The use of any material except wood for bracing on
<br />
A-6 models shall not be acceptable. The intent of the A-6 rules is that all
<br />
structures shall be constructed entirely from wood, using adhesives solely
<br />
to assemble the structure. 
<br />
<br />12. Propeller shall be 6&quot; maximum diameter. Maximum of two (2) blades, which
<br />
shall be flat 1/32&quot; sheet wood with no camber. All blade edges must be left
<br />
square and no part of either blade shall be thinner than 1/32&quot;. No gadgets
<br />
of any kind (such as variable-pitch or variable diameter mechanisms) are
<br />
permitted as part of the propeller. Propeller hubs which permit blade
<br />
replacement and manual pitch adjustment are acceptable. 
<br />
<br />13. Reinforcement utilizing fiberglass, boron, carbon fiber, Kevlar, or any
<br />
other non-wood substance is not allowed on any part of an A-6 model. Tissue
<br />
or thread wrapping at the thrust bearing and rear hook is acceptable. 
<br />
<br />14. It is prohibited to use any scheme, device, or mechanism which affects
<br />
the rate of energy release from the rubber motor, except for propeller blade
<br />
flare or deformation. Rubber or plastic sleeves may be used at the front and
<br />
rear hooks to prevent bunching of the rubber motor.

<br />
<br />Here was my response:
<br />
<br />Sounds like they did better campaigning. If the cross proposal was 
<br />
dismissed then either the consequences of the simpler rules needed to be 
<br />
campaigned on the ICB members and explained in detail as what will 
<br />
happen if the corrections were not made, such as biplanes, VPs, etc 
<br />
since the rules would be now under AMA guidelines. If they would not 
<br />
accept them you withdraw the basic proposal (which is allowed before the 
<br />
final vote) because what will be adopted would not be what was intended 
<br />
or how A-6 has been flown. Better to hold off 
<br />
reorganized/rewritten/recampaign and submitted the next rules cycle.
<br />
<br />My issue with Deloach blaming the ICB is that the current rules are in 
<br />
essence exactly what he originally wrote in his original proposal that 
<br />
was submitted (with all loopholes in place). So if it passed as he 
<br />
proposed we would be in the same situation we are in now. So his 
<br />
criticism of the current rules is invalid as his rules would have had 
<br />
the same loopholes under the AMA. He wanted to make A-6 an AMA event 
<br />
and he starting the whole process in motion. Yes the ICB messed up BUT 
<br />
to simply point the finger at them while washing his hands of it all is 
<br />
not right. If he never initiated the AMA conversion of A-6 then the ICB 
<br />
would not have had anything to vote on.
<br />
