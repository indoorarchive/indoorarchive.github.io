&quot;Josh as soon as someone like you starts throwing around words like STUPID and Ridiculous it denigrates the process of debate and shows you have run out of ideas with which to intelligently debate the issue. It also possibly shows that you wouldn't recognize an original idea if it bit you on your pompous butt.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Irony: accusing me of calling you names, which I didn't, and then calling me one.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Bill, you would do well to get less emotionally invested in a rules proposal. Don Deloach has maintained that approach and actually gained ground. You on the other hand have erupted into rage because I and at least two others have consistently countered your points and asked the same questions over and over which you have refused to answer. Further, you have promulgated libelous statements about me like &quot;Josh, the fact that you can only see winning as a motivation for beginners demonstrates the problem at hand.&quot; That item is on its face absolutely absurd given that I participate in more non competition model flying events in a year than most indoor fliers attend in a lifetime.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;You've stated &quot;We have had a myriad of beginner events  over the years and they all followed the same path. They are quickly dominated by experts and lose all appeal to beginners. What I am proposing is simply to TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT.&quot;, but the fallacy if this argument is that you're not doing anything different. As written, the event is just another simple model event which will doubtless follow the same course, unless of course you alienate all the &quot;experts&quot; from the event in which case it will die of nonparticipating since the experts are the ones that beginners come to for suggestions as to which model to build. Neither of those achieves your goals because of the myriad of reasons stated by John Kagan over four years ago.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;All of this is a moot point because you have been queried over and over to answer our collective question of &quot;why have a competition event for beginners if winning isn't for them?&quot; and have sidestepped that question every single time. I'm done with this discussion. From the emails I've received off list, it is clear that you have made my point to the indoor community at large, which was my hope from the start of this debate.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;In closing, what saddens me is that you, as an expert modeler who has probably attended USIC longer than I've been alive and have mastered model types that most freeflighters never succeed at in a lifetime have proceeded to attack someone who once counted you a friend. I've flown with you on multiple occasions, not in competition any of those times, and I had an absolute blast doing so. I thought you had the same feeling, and I loved watching your models flying endlessly, demonstrating the level of performance that you now decry as demotivating to beginners. Please disconnect your emotions from the indoor political process and accept the opinions of the rest of us as equally as valid as your own. I welcome a civil debate on this topic, but it has gone far past that.
