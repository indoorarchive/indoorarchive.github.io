&quot;On the whole winning is not the point for the beginner.  And by the way, there is plenty of incentive and building and flying to be done by a beginner before he or she gets to the point that they can do two minutes three times in one day.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Hence the continued question, asked by at least three of us now: why have a competition event for beginners if winning isn't for them? Please answer this question. If this cannot be answered, I will have to start campaigning against the adoption of P-18 because it will be clear that it is a waste of space in the rules book.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&quot;It is seeing things from the top down that make us think winning and records are what matters. If we don't have more participants in a few years it'll be really easy to win and set records all alone.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;See, this is exactly what I'm talking about. I just gave evidence that declining participation is not the case, gave specific examples both here and abroad of newcomers to the hobby, and the same mantra of &quot;indoor is dying&quot; gets quoted without evidence when I just presented evidence to the contrary.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I'm bothered by this behavior, not because of the correctness or lack thereof, but because it represents an agenda. If indoor is dying in spite of my efforts, then something else has to be changed (P-18). On the other hand, if indoor is growing globally because of the dissemination of information and tutorials helping newcomers to understand advanced techniques, then the current slate of events is just fine, and the solution to growing indoor is to provide better information and publicity.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Because of the above, it is clear that this has become a political fight in indoor over the perception of what problems exist and which ones don't. So I have a theory--indoor is being damaged by offending experienced modelers and running them off. Maybe we should ban anti-competition types from having input into the rules. Same concept, right? Can you not see that what makes that item ridiculous and stupid also makes this 2 minute max nonsense just as ridiculous and stupid?
