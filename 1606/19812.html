Bill, I would like to voice my opposition to changing the P-18 event. Let's get it passed while the momentum to fly is strong! 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Timing is everything is seems. Let's craft a workable SO style event over the next year or two and introduce it then. Move forward with the  proposed P-18 event. It's time that we had an event dedicated to Novice-Indoor-Fliers (NIF). The P-18 is crafted is such a way that it represents a crossover from 'heavies&quot; to &quot;light endurance&quot;. It already has a documented track record as a &quot;trial&quot; event, imagine what it brings as an official event!  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;The NIF come to us in many ways. The largest current populations of AMA members flying indoors are NON-&quot;Endurance&quot; fliers. They enjoy Bostonians, No-Cals, ROG's, Delta Darts, Embryo, various Scale Events and RC. Having an event that remains in a standardized format with rules remaining static for a number of years has its appeal to current AMA NIF's. They understand the rule set-up and can build and fly accordingly.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;For us to drop this particular path (P-18) for exploring as a quasi-endurance experience would be harmful to the sport as we lose a large population of AMA NIF prospects.   
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;If the event is re-created into a Science Olympiad styled event, we will have rubber-powered airplanes for the next two years but lose rubber powered airplanes for the following two years. Can we successfully nurture an AMA NIF using helicopters and gliders into the endurance arena? Probably not. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Chances are that re-built set of P-18 rules will take an extended amount of decision making before that rotational concept can be made to work in the AMA format. That loss of time also loses prospective NIFs.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;We, at SO, have already created rules for the B division (MS) Wright Stuff event to be very close to the P-18 this year (P-45cm). For what amounts to a 4-year stretch, these models will be virtually legal to fly as a P-18's. That's more momentum not less!
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;If we eliminate P-18 and only have the SO rotational, we cut our prospects in half.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;In addition, by the time WS comes back into high school (after a 2-year disappearance), it will come back as a  more complicated model. It will be more complex than the P-18 but both airplanes substantially less complicated that LPP or F1L. By that time p-18 fliers can step-up into WS style models.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Let's move forward and get P-18 approved so that we can capitalize on the momentum we have. Let's commit to carefully crafting a future SO rotational style event that can clear the hurdles in AMA formats.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;In the end, we will have TWO solid intros to endurance rubber-powered airplanes. Think about it, if you are going to a contest, would you rather have two events to place or just one?  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Regards,
<br />
