Maybe ya'all should query the population who you are intending to serve with this proposal to see what they think?
<br />

<br />
As I have said in the past, we want to catch fish. Not all fish respond to the same bait. Having more than one bait in the tackle box to entice the fish to bite is a good idea.
<br />

<br />
P18 is but one possible lure. Lots of models can be good learning platforms - and that seems to be the point.
<br />

<br />
Bill, you proposed the max out idea. It is fine, but somewhat limiting. You say you don't want to see a P18 doing five minutes. So kids learn to max out to 2 minutes, but never go further. Never learn the true potential of the design.
<br />

<br />
Am reminded of an SO competition I attended back in March. A team had probably the best model there and was doing 20 seconds. My son's plane was doing 90 seconds consistently. I tried to help, but they were dismissive. Didn't want my help. Ok. I tell them anyway - You need to wind it up more. They didn't listen. After the contest was over, Chuck Markos walks over, and grabs a motor and a winder, winds the bejeezus out of the motor, hooks it up and lets it go. It came down at something close to 2 minutes. They were shocked.
<br />
They had no idea that their model was capable of more than 30 seconds. Even my son at 10 knew that they needed to wind it harder.
<br />

<br />
You say you don't want to see a P18 doing five minutes. I think beginners need to see this though as it is a gauge of how well they are doing. 
<br />

<br />
Regards.
