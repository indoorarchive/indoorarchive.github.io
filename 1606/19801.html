Ok, as Bill Gowen rightly stated, the process continues to cross proposals. I have zero experience actually writing those and I definitely am not equipped to write a reasonable set of rules, but I still propose that we proceed toward adopting the annual SO rules as an official AMA event, with said event specifically written to avoid collation of national records. This shouldn't be difficult, since the wording of AMA's F1D, F1R, etc events can probably just be rewritten to substitute SO for FAI. Per Tom Sanders' posts on HPA, the next iteration of Wright Stuff rules will closely resemble the current version of P-18, so the proponents of P-18 should find some solace in that. Since the rules will change each year, &quot;experts&quot; will be prevented from optimizing the event beyond the level of most students. Sounds like a win-win to me, and a straightforward one.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I propose a twist on it, though, that the event be split into two categories (don't know if this can be done this cycle...can someone answer as to whether a cross proposal can do this?) to cover both Division B and C of Wright Stuff. As for a name, some whimsical names have been presented, but I suggest that it's more respectful to beginners and students to have a more formal name. I'd propose &quot;B Indoor&quot; and &quot;C Indoor&quot; as names, with the reference in the rules that they refer to the specific flying event rules sanctioned by Science Olympiad (don't even reference &quot;Wright Stuff&quot;).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;This would provide a good rotation of events including gliders and helicopters and in addition to providing nice classes for indoor beginners and competitive opportunities for students, it also provides more business to the startups that market kits for those classes. I'd also suggest at least considering dropping the BOM rule for these events, and I'd like to see that at least given consideration even if we don't adopt it. My reasoning is that since the rules change annually, high priced models are rendered uneconomical, and it provides more opportunity for beginners to access the event(s).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Thoughts?
<br />
