So I have no dog in this fight as my personal goals in indoor are breaking LPP and F1L records and getting decent at F1D, thus leaving little time or energy for less competitive events. 
<br />
<br />But what I do want to know is with all of the time and energy being put into P18, what is the desired outcome of adopting this event?  Is it to attract new indoor fliers?  Is it to create/produce life long indoor enthusiasts?  Is it to create an event that discourages certain fliers from
<br />
participating so some new names can be on the podium?  Just what exactly is trying to be done with P18?
<br />
<br />I can see how the event would allow some people other than the usual suspects to win, as they have already stated they won't fly it.  But how does it create interest and lifelong participation more so than any other event?  Is the idea that someone new to indoor can be competitive in P18, and possibly win that event, and then be hooked for life because they won something?  What happens to that person when they try another event and don't win?  If, as has been suggested, competition scares people away, then where do these people go?  Do they go back to P18 and beat up on the less experienced fliers, and P18 in a few short seasons follows the same trend that every other indoor event has followed, or do they leave indoor?
<br />
<br />I guess I still fail to see how this event really grows indoor flying as it is intended to do.  
<br />
<br />So again I ask, is this event designed to truly and sustainably grow indoor aeromodeling?  Is this event just for fun to expose people to the hobby and get them to some contests to see what indoor is like?  Or is this event designed to give some different faces a chance at winning?
<br />
<br />A lot of effort is being put into this event.  I just want to make sure everyone involved knows why it is being worked on so hard.  Answer the above questions to the satisfaction of the indoor community, and I am sure it will be supported.  Right now though, with the existence of plastic prop events like Phantom Flash and Jetco ROG, I fail to see the niche P18 fills.  
<br />
<br />Please educate me on what this event is try to do and how it will meet those goals.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe you can just make a list of all the people who you consider too advanced to fly the event and attach that to the rules.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Ray,

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I propose that this event be flown as a two minute max event. No fly offs, no tie breakers. If an contestant wants to get full credit for his/her efforts they may but the times are scored as an official in LPP.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The purpose of this proposal is the remove the incentive of &quot;Experts&quot; from flooding the event and making it unappealing to a true beginner. If you can get one of these things to fly for two minutes three times in one day you are probably ready to tackle a true LPP and then... By the time a beginner has gotten enough experience to &quot;Max Out&quot; a P-18 he or she has set the Indoor FF hook pretty deep.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The rules, as written, produce an airplane that make two minutes  a nominal goal. I kike seeing these models fly as they are very &quot;indoor  like&quot; and I've seen their appeal to the public. I just don't want to see these things doing 5 minutes. Sure irt can probably be done but that is not the point of the event.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Thoughts?

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I expect to submit one to change the prop size max to 6&quot;, instead of 5.5&quot;. There are a lot more 6&quot; props out there than 5.5's, namely at Volare who has six kinds of 6&quot; props.
