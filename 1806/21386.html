Hi Don,
<br />
<br />         I think your proposal is an excellent one.   
<br />
<br />There is a more general issue that I would like to see happen.  Specifically for indoor, but outdoor could also use this concept.
<br />
<br />The concept is to keep and post somewhere on the web,  I think the best place would be NFFS,  best times for a event at that specific site, basically site records.    I believe Don DeLoach has done this for the indoor site in Colorado Springs and posts it on the MMM Yahoo group and there are likely others examples too.  Again the basic reason is similar to yours:  Site  records are mainly a way for modelers to compare themselves to other modelers that have flown at that site.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Just a thought?
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
Kurt

Dear Indoor FF community,
<br />
<br />I am passing this memo along to the indoor list as this will have a direct impact on USA national records for FAI events. Basically what is happening is the AMA is no longer handling the records for FAI classes (F1D, F1L, F1M, F1R, F1N) . They are going to be processed by NAA and will cost $125 with a certificate. The other AMA classes such as Limited Pennyplane, EZB, etc will still be free through the AMA. 
<br />
<br />I think this fee is ridiculous as it is just a national 
<br />
record. I feel the national records are mainly a way for USA modelers to compare themselves to other modelers across the USA. I am not sure if as individuals we really care if our record is officially certified by NAA or not. My guess is most will not be willing to pay the $125 fee plus I assume one must be a NAA license holder as well. I also think the NAA records will not distinguish the classes into ages either. So junior and senior modelers will be flying against adult NAA records. 
<br />
<br />In preparation for this possibly happening, Don DeLoach and I already discussed the idea of NFFS becoming the keeper of national records in these FAI indoor classes. Since I do the records for Indoor FF already, I can make a new form and we can start tracking them ourselves. I have no problem doing this and would like to keep up the tradition of sending out certificates as well. 
<br />
<br />So a person setting a new national record in a class like F1D, they then have a choice to submit to NFFS only or to also submit to AMA with $125 to have it recognized by NAA. Yes it will mean official NAA records and the unofficial NFFS record may not be the same but I see no way around this if we want to keep a system like it has been for so many years. 
<br />
<br />I am open for any other ideas or suggestions. The memo from the AMA is below.

<br />Dear Contest Board Chairman:
<br />
I am contacting you to let you know of a change in our US National Record process.
<br />
<br />At the April Executive Council meeting, an item on the agenda was US National records. This issue came about when trying to get a better understanding of what NAA (National Aeronautic Association) does for AMA. The discussion turned to national records and it was recommended that NAA handle all FAI records, both World Records and National Records. It seems that both AMA and NAA had been doing this, with several individuals submitting US National record applications directly to NAA, but the council didn’t want dual records out there and voted to have NAA handle all FAI events that have records.
<br />
<br />So, starting on July 1st, 2018, AMA will no longer include FAI events in our National Record database. That will all go to NAA. As of July 1st, all FAI events seeking US National records will fill out the FAI paperwork and send in to AMA. AMA will verify all the needed documentation is supplied and forward this to NAA. 
<br />
<br />The fee for submitting an FAI event US National record is $100.00. In addition, if they want a certificate from NAA for their record, that is an additional $25.00. The record will be verified by NAA and, if approved, included in their database of records.
<br />
<br />I have been in communication with NAA about this process and they believe they will have everything in place for the July 1st deadline.
<br />
<br />I know that many Indoor FF modelers will be very unhappy with now having to pay $100 (+ $25 if they want a certificate), and I stated that to the AMA Executive Council, this will be the new process. Note that ALL National record applications still are sent to AMA HQ (AMA events &amp; FAI events). AMA event National Records will still be handled as we have done for some many years, and there is still no charge for a record application. Only FAI events have changed. US National Records for FAI events require filling out the applicable FAI record dossier and sending it along with payment to AMA HQ. AMA will then forward it to NAA.
<br />
<br />I will be happy to field any questions, but don’t shoot me! I’m just the messenger!
<br />
<br />You might want to put this out to your SIGs and any other groups that might be involved. We will be making announcements through AMA media as well.
