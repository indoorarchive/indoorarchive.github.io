Hi Jake,
<br />
<br />         To be clear, Mark's time is probably for F1N not HLG.     I believe Mark was flying a glider larger than 100 sq in(could check with Mark) .  The AMA HLG rules states models must be under 100sq in.  F1N rules do not limit wing area.
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
Kurt

<br />INAV 117 has a contest report from the 2005 Kibbie Dome Annual, but it omits the full HLG results.  The article does state that Mark did 168.3 with a discus glider so I'll amend the site records to include Mark's time.

<br />Kurt,
<br />
It looks like this was a typo in INAV 95 where I got the info.  Catapult glider was reported in a format of minutes and seconds, but HLG was typed as seconds.  I'm guessing it should have also been minutes and seconds (even though this isn't the standard format for gliders), so Bob's actual time was 2:26.2, or 146.2 seconds.  I'll change that site record for now, and I'll need to go back through all of the old results to see if anyone has done better than 146..2.  Thanks for the tip.
<br />

<br />Hi Jake,
<br />
<br />      It's great that you have a list. Thank you making it public.    Since I mainly fly gliders I took a look at the glider times.   I was surprised at the time I saw for HLG, and question whether this is a typo.    In 1998 a two flight total of 226.2 would not only be a Kibbie site record but it would also a National Record today.   The current AMA record is 209.4 which was set in 2010.    I believe in 1998 the National record was around 180 seconds for HLG.  So either Bob didn't apply for a national record or the posted time on the spreadsheet is incorrect.
<br />
<br />      Also, I believe in 2005 Mark Benns set an F1N record in the Kibbie dome, I was there that year(it was the Battle of Seattle) and watched him set it with a new concept of tip launching.   I don't remember the exact time, but it was around 168 seconds and a historic event for indoor HLG!
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
Kurt

<br />I've already compiled a site records list for Kibbie.  It's based on all the published results I could find going back to the late 80's.​

<br />I've got a nearly complete spreadsheet of Nats winners. From it you could glean a bunch of site records, mainly ETSU.

Kurt,
<br />
<br />My dad and I were discussing that after Kent as well. It is a great idea. I think we can dig up contest results from the past years to start populating a chart for various sites.
