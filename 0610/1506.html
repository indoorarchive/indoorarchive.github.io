<br />
To interested members of the Yahoo Indoor Group,
<br />
<br />The annual business meeting of the Western New York Free Flight Society will
<br />
be held On November 18. An important item on the agenda will be whether or
<br />
not to continue holding our annual indoor contest, the Empire State Indoor
<br />
Championships, at the Buffalo Bills fieldhouse- or anywhere else, for that
<br />
matter. As some of you know, attendance at these meets over the past four or
<br />
five years has been minimal, with only 18 contestants showing up for the
<br />
most recent meet, held May 21. Both my club, the Western New York Free
<br />
Flight Society, and the co-sponsoring Flying Aces Club, took virtually
<br />
unacceptable financial losses as a result. These are chiefly because of the
<br />
building rental fee of $1,000 for the day which requires a turnout of at
<br />
least 35 open contestants at $30 per to break even. The inclusion of an
<br />
after-the-meet RC electric fun fly saw only a handful of fliers show up and
<br />
failed to stanch the bleeding.
<br />
<br />I recently heard from a fellow modeler who kindly passed along the results
<br />
of an informal survey he'd done to seek reasons for the continuing epidemic
<br />
of no-shows at the contest. He found three. Here they are, with my 
<br />
responses:
<br />
<br />1. Bad impression of the place because the excessive heat
<br />
generated from the indirect lighting pushed the planes to the girders or
<br />
formed a difficult to penetrate &quot;ceiling.&quot;
<br />
<br />This is certainly a legitimate criticism from those flying the ultralight
<br />
events
<br />
such as Easy B, Penny Plane, etc. But the lights have caused no significant
<br />
problems with other events, such as scale and catapult glider. And we turned
<br />
off some of the lights at the 2006 contest which, according to John Kagan,
<br />
apparently solved the &quot;ceiling&quot; and drift problems. But attendance by
<br />
those who would fly non-lightweight events has suffered as much as the
<br />
lightweights. Some of the scale guys from out of state tell us that they
<br />
love the site but a one-day
<br />
contest isn't worth the trip. We did try a two day contest two years ago but
<br />
attendance was a disaster.
<br />
<br />2. The nearness to the USIC at Johnson City.
<br />
<br />There's not a lot I can do here. Sandwiching the Buffalo contest into a busy
<br />
spring schedule is no easy task, and the building with heat turned off would
<br />
be very uncomfortable if we tried to hold the contest on most weekends in
<br />
February, March, or April.
<br />
Also, the treacherous upstate New York late winter weather could easily be a
<br />
factor in  getting to and from the site during any of those months. We tried
<br />
a fall contest once, and it was another attendance
<br />
flop.
<br />
<br />3. The uncertainty that the event could be canceled in short notice due to
<br />
the Bills deciding to practice at any moment.
<br />
<br />This one is specious, since only once in all the years we've held the
<br />
contest at the Bills fieldhouse did they pull a switch on us that required a
<br />
change of date. But once doesn't make a trend or a continuing threat. This,
<br />
I
<br />
believe, is a complaint without merit.
<br />
<br />So there we are. We've worked hard to make this contest attractive to indoor
<br />
fliers. Those who have attended have told us we've succeeded. The site,
<br />
lights or not, is still one of the best available in the entire eastern
<br />
portion of the country. I don't know how the two clubs will vote on this,
<br />
but speaking for myself I'm about ready to throw in the proverbial towel.
<br />
Gentelemen, I believe the future of the ESIC hangs by a thread.
<br />
<br /><br />Bob Clemens
