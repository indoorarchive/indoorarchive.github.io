<br />
A couple of quick points, and then I need to go to bed.  First, I did 
<br />
not mean to completely ignore the nuts and bolts.  From what I have 
<br />
seen, the nuts and bolts are that the majority of people want paper, 
<br />
hard copies.  If say, 50 people want electronic copies only, we loose 
<br />
our bulk mailing rate and the cost increases significantly for the 
<br />
other 150 people who would still like to get paper copies.  
<br />
The &quot;mixture&quot; does not work fiscally, and that is the bottom line.  
<br />
As I said before, if 75% of the subscribers want an all electronic 
<br />
version, we will take it under serious consideration.  I do not see 
<br />
how this is nonsensical in any way.  
<br />
<br />Bill, I know you have worked very hard for INAV and hope you continue 
<br />
to do so, but, to quote Bentham, [t]he said truth is that it is the 
<br />
greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of 
<br />
right and wrong.
<br />
<br />The month wait is what we are trying out right now, perhaps we will 
<br />
eliminate it in the future if this is what the subscribers want.  As 
<br />
for cost of database and website &#x2013; we aren't paying someone 
<br />
currently, Jeff Hood has donated server space.  Again, this was 
<br />
stated clearly on the new website.  However, if this is to be a 
<br />
continuing venture, bandwidth, server space, cannot be taken for 
<br />
granted. And by the way &#x2013; less than 30 (thirty) subscribers have 
<br />
requested passwords for the website to enable them to download the 
<br />
issues.  
<br />
<br />I apologize in advance for this, but Bill, suggesting that $15 a year 
<br />
is too much for someone who can afford $35-50 a month for broadband 
<br />
access, well, this to me is nonsensical (no one with dial up is 
<br />
downloading 3-10 meg documents). 
<br />
<br />I've gotten one email so far saying they want only electronic 
<br />
versions.   I have an obligation to the entire group that subscribes 
<br />
to deliver what they want.  I need 148 more emails or letters before 
<br />
I feel that a majority of the group wants to do away with the paper 
<br />
copies.       
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
<br />Tony

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm sorry that you found my monetary references to be offensive. I 
</em><br />
feel that there is some justification to bringing this up - and it's 
<br />
not that I distrust any specific person involved with INAV. The 
<br />
reason is that every time I bring up a question about why there is a 
<br />
subscription fee for INAV I get slammed with nonsensical reasons why 
<br />
it isn't a practical idea.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In your response for instance you completely ignored the nuts and 
</em><br />
bolts of what I was suggesting and instead took the approach that 
<br />
INAV is going to be either a printed publication or an electronic 
<br />
publication, while what I was suggesting was a mixture depending on 
<br />
the needs of the subscriber. I personally would rather not receive a 
<br />
printed copy at all. There may actually be some other nuts on the 
<br />
list who feel the same way. I would also rather not have to wait 
<br />
another month to get my issue if I choose to get an electronic copy.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My club newsletter is produced by one person, converted to PDF by 
</em><br />
another and then emailed to the membership. When I was doing the 
<br />
emailing the whole process involved hitting the create button, typing 
<br />
TTOMA in the address line, attaching the file and hitting send. On a 
<br />
bad day it might take a minute. Where is the cost in this process? 
<br />
When there are changes in the club roster I do have to spend time 
<br />
making them in order for it to be up to date. If the future 
<br />
electronic INAV is charging for subscriptions in order to maintain 
<br />
the database and website does that mean that we are paying someone to 
<br />
do that work? If the subscription fee were removed I would be happy 
<br />
to perform that task and wouldn't even charge for it!
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; $15 is not much money to me and probably not to you, but there are 
</em><br />
a lot of people in this sport who have to watch where their money 
<br />
goes more carefully than you and I do.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Bill et al:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   INAV, moving forward is going to be available for electronic 
</em><br />
delivery 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   via download. As noted on the front page of the new website 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   <a href="http://www.indoornewsandviews.com/">http://www.indoornewsandviews.com/</a>:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   &quot;... moving forward, approximately one month after publication 
</em><br />
and 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   mailing of the new paper issues, we will make electronic copies 
</em><br />
of 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   the new issues available in the subscriber's only section.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Any subscriber can get password, and a month after mailing, they 
</em><br />
can 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   download the latest issue, as well as the back issues down to 
</em><br />
#102. 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   As for the subscription fee, I will give a short summary, and we 
</em><br />
plan 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   to start an annual accounting in the future. In a nutshell, yes, 
</em><br />
the 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   subscription covers mailing and printing. But Bill, from 
</em><br />
everything 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   I have seen, most of our subscribers still want paper copies. 
</em><br />
Until 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   I get 150 emails/letters (we have about 200 subscribers) from 
</em><br />
folks 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   saying otherwise, I think moving from hardcopy would be unfair to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   most of the subscribers. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   BTW - INAV is volunteer only, no one gets paid, or makes any 
</em><br />
money. 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   In fact, the tone of that comment is right on the line of being a 
</em><br />
bit 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   offensive. Everyone who puts time into this is giving up family 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   time, building/flying time, work time. While I'm sure no offense 
</em><br />
was 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   intended, I would ask that all choose their words carefully when 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   making statements about the finances of INAV in the context of it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   being a volunteer run newsletter. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Second, I think $15 is very reasonable. Yes, we tend to get the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   issues out a bit late, but they get out. Also, we are trying to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   maintain a 40 year old tradition here. Nothing is free, and even 
</em><br />
if 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   we moved to wholly electronic (note I said &quot;if&quot;), I would still 
</em><br />
want 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   to charge a subscription to maintain a website and database. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   This publication is of course run and produced for the Indoor 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   community, so if as I noted, 3/4 of the subscribers write in and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   request your proposed changes we would of course take that into 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   serious consideration. However, until I get a majority of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   subscribers looking for change, we will keep doing what we are 
</em><br />
doing 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   and trying to put out a better newsletter each quarter.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; I have a couple of suggestions for the INAV staff which I would 
</em><br />
like
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; to share with the list membership as a whole:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; 1. Many have asked about an electronic delivery of INAV and 
</em><br />
reasons
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; have been offered for not doing it that way. Here's an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   alternative -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; how about electronic copies for those who want it that way and 
</em><br />
paper
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; copies for the others? I am presently in charge of the 
</em><br />
electronic
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; distribution of my club newspaper and it takes maybe 30 seconds 
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; send it out. Doing a split delivery system would obviously 
</em><br />
reduce 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; work load and expense of getting an issue out. I would MUCH 
</em><br />
prefer 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; electronic copy. I can store thousands of documents on my 
</em><br />
computer 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; access them any time I need to. My copies of INAV are in bulging
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; binders that are heavy and cumbersome. A lot of times I will 
</em><br />
trust 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; memory instead of trying to find something in my hard copies. 
</em><br />
At my
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; age this is not always a good idea!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; 2. I have been told many times that INAV is an all volunteer 
</em><br />
effort.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; My literal interpretation of this is that there's not supposed 
</em><br />
to be
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; any money left over after printing and delivery costs are paid. 
</em><br />
If
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; this is the case, and if electronic delivery is essentially 
</em><br />
free of
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; both expense and work, why is it necessary to charge for INAV? 
</em><br />
If a
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; subscriber wants to get a hard copy there could be a 
</em><br />
subscription 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   fee
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; that would cover the costs of providing it. For those receiving 
</em><br />
an
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; electonic copy it would just be a matter of asking to be on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   list.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; I would be interested in hearing both from the editors and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   publishers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;   &gt; of INAV as well as the list membership in general.
