<br />
Bob,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;You bring up two very good questions. I've noticed few top notch WS 
<br />
students only want to go as far as other indoor models like Penny 
<br />
Planes etc. nothing wrong with that. They are just as important to 
<br />
Rubber Power Indoor world as a F1D. From speaking with them they 
<br />
said it wasn't that a F1D scared them so much, just their interest 
<br />
was elsewhere.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Jumping from WS model to F1D is hard No one living on earth will 
<br />
say otherwise. It can be and has been done several times though. The 
<br />
latest would be Justin Young who has never flown anything in 
<br />
between. There have been several who only dabbled in other Indoor 
<br />
models then took on F1D full time. The thing to remember is, in my 
<br />
opinion that WS plane's basically has all rubber and building skills 
<br />
needed for an F1D. Well, actually the prop is what holds them back 
<br />
for a while. Still many of prop skills have already been learned. 
<br />
What's more important is number years, contests, number of models 
<br />
built and testing sessions that a WS student has under his belt 
<br />
before moving on. That will not be there at all for BLG kids. 
<br />
<br />Let's take a student like Nick Ray for instance. He learned void of 
<br />
a mentor close by. He had to travel to contests where he came in 
<br />
contact with knowledgeable people like Bill. The point is Nick as 
<br />
good as he is now took longer to make it to F1D's than others with 
<br />
mentors close at hand. I would believe a BLG kid in Nick's shoes 
<br />
would never get around to F1D out of share lack of time. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;In most cases of a Junior F1D success they were found by a Indoor 
<br />
flyer and asked to try their hand at it. They were found at a WS 
<br />
contest. Their skill noticed then PERSONAL attention paid in helping 
<br />
with the WS model long before actually asking them to build a F1D. 
<br />
That sequence cannot happen with BLG. A WS flyer like Brett Sanborn 
<br />
would never have been noticed as an example of many others. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Consider the mentioned rotation of events that WS only is to stay 
<br />
for two years in high or middle school. The plan is bottle rockets 
<br />
will be there for two year stretches with either BLG or WS totally 
<br />
missing. Most of the kids have progressed took longer than two years 
<br />
to find Indoor Rubber. Doug Schaefer would of missed it. Chalker 
<br />
took from seventh grade to about his Junior year in High school to 
<br />
be on the scene. I could name others. The only exceptions would be 
<br />
sons of fathers who got into Indoor like the Rigotti's. Would a 
<br />
circumstance like Ben Saks or Johnson's that had a friend into 
<br />
flying went any further if WS had been suddenly stopped in their 
<br />
life? Hard one to answer for me.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;BLG did show me some skills needed for F1D even better than WS 
<br />
demanded but with increased weight rule of BLG that won't be needed. 
<br />
From mentoring our school last year to second in State there isn't 
<br />
enough needed skills coming out of BLG to jump into F1D. Moving to 
<br />
something else in Indoor would be wise IMHO. The bigger problem as 
<br />
mentioned above is they won't stay at even BLG long enough to get 
<br />
interested in a scale model.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;One RUMOR I would like to address is notion that without BLG coming 
<br />
in, any sort of flying event would have been lost for several years 
<br />
in S.O.. That simply is not true. Those of you who fought hard and 
<br />
saved WS five years a go know better. BLG didn't have to come in 
<br />
now. That was all a scare tactic by same people who ran off great 
<br />
number of good hearted mentors all across the nation. 
<br />
