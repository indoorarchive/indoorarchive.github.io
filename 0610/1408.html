Hi Hack,
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I too share your worry as does many other people. I know there are
<br />
people that are upset that the BLG made it into Div B...however, if it
<br />
hadn't passed there probably wouldn't have been any other flying
<br />
event for a few years.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I think we need to work on the new BLG kids. Many of the same mentors
<br />
for WS are now helping the BLG kids. We all need to encourage them to
<br />
move onto the next levels...WS and then F1D's. I'll do my best to
<br />
encourage Kelsey and Kyle to go for the gusto....but of course...in the
<br />
long run it will be up to them.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />My son Ashby who usually assists Kelsey with launching her BLG is
<br />
showing an interest in building this year. Honestly...I don't know
<br />
what to make of it right now...because last year he had no interest at
<br />
all. He was only involved because the rest of the family was. Perhaps he
<br />
doesn't want to just sit around until its time for him to
<br />
participate anymore. Or perhaps...thanks to spending all that time in
<br />
the gym with Kelsey and Kyle...he has caught the bug. I think I'll have
<br />
him start with either a glider...or an easy WS plane. But I do have to
<br />
be careful...as soon as I try to push my own kids to do one thing...they
<br />
want to do the opposite...lol.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />So...Does anyone have any suggestions for a 1st timer? His only
<br />
experience was years ago working here and there building a RC with his
<br />
grandfather.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Anyway...I would also like to encourage anyone who is also a member over
<br />
at Balloon Launch Glider to please talk it up about the AMA, Romania,
<br />
Wright Stuff, etc. I can't do it alone...remember I'm still new to
<br />
all this...and most of my experience is based on the BLG. But I too see
<br />
the need for building the next generation of flyers. And I will do my
<br />
best to be a good will ambassador promoting the F1D competitions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />BTW...Hack is you helping out the kids at Solon this year? I have to say
<br />
that the kids I met last year at state were not only good flyers but
<br />
just amazing kids. They were so friendly and so into discussing both of
<br />
the flying events. I think Solon has been very lucky to have such a
<br />
caring and wonderful mentor as yourself all these years.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />And that goes for Kelsey and I too...I'm so glad we were able to meet
<br />
you this past year and that you have been there and have helped us out
<br />
along the way. Your encouragement helped give Kelsey &quot;a belief in
<br />
herself&quot; that she needed to become a strong competitor in the BLG. Thank
<br />
you!
<br />
<br /><br /><br />If you or anyone else has any other suggestions how to get the kids
<br />
involved in flying F1Ds...please speak up. And if there is anything I
<br />
can do on my end...please let me know.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Lori
