I'm sorry that you found my monetary references to be offensive. I feel that there is some justification to bringing this up - and it's not that I distrust any specific person involved with INAV. The reason is that every time I bring up a question about why there is a subscription fee for INAV I get slammed with nonsensical reasons why it isn't a practical idea.
<br />
<br />In your response for instance you completely ignored the nuts and bolts of what I was suggesting and instead took the approach that INAV is going to be either a printed publication or an electronic publication, while what I was suggesting was a mixture depending on the needs of the subscriber. I personally would rather not receive a printed copy at all. There may actually be some other nuts on the list who feel the same way. I would also rather not have to wait another month to get my issue if I choose to get an electronic copy.
<br />
<br />My club newsletter is produced by one person, converted to PDF by another and then emailed to the membership. When I was doing the emailing the whole process involved hitting the create button, typing TTOMA in the address line, attaching the file and hitting send. On a bad day it might take a minute. Where is the cost in this process? When there are changes in the club roster I do have to spend time making them in order for it to be up to date. If the future electronic INAV is charging for subscriptions in order to maintain the database and website does that mean that we are paying someone to do that work? If the subscription fee were removed I would be happy to perform that task and wouldn't even charge for it!
<br />
<br />$15 is not much money to me and probably not to you, but there are a lot of people in this sport who have to watch where their money goes more carefully than you and I do. 
<br />
<br />I'm retiring from my soap box now.

<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill et al:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;INAV, moving forward is going to be available for electronic delivery 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;via download. As noted on the front page of the new website 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.indoornewsandviews.com/">http://www.indoornewsandviews.com/</a>:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;... moving forward, approximately one month after publication and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;mailing of the new paper issues, we will make electronic copies of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the new issues available in the subscriber's only section.&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Any subscriber can get password, and a month after mailing, they can 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;download the latest issue, as well as the back issues down to #102. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the subscription fee, I will give a short summary, and we plan 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to start an annual accounting in the future. In a nutshell, yes, the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;subscription covers mailing and printing. But Bill, from everything 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen, most of our subscribers still want paper copies. Until 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I get 150 emails/letters (we have about 200 subscribers) from folks 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;saying otherwise, I think moving from hardcopy would be unfair to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;most of the subscribers. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW - INAV is volunteer only, no one gets paid, or makes any money. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the tone of that comment is right on the line of being a bit 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;offensive. Everyone who puts time into this is giving up family 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;time, building/flying time, work time. While I'm sure no offense was 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;intended, I would ask that all choose their words carefully when 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;making statements about the finances of INAV in the context of it 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;being a volunteer run newsletter. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I think $15 is very reasonable. Yes, we tend to get the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;issues out a bit late, but they get out. Also, we are trying to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;maintain a 40 year old tradition here. Nothing is free, and even if 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;we moved to wholly electronic (note I said &quot;if&quot;), I would still want 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to charge a subscription to maintain a website and database. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This publication is of course run and produced for the Indoor 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;community, so if as I noted, 3/4 of the subscribers write in and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;request your proposed changes we would of course take that into 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;serious consideration. However, until I get a majority of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;subscribers looking for change, we will keep doing what we are doing 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and trying to put out a better newsletter each quarter. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Sincerely,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Tony Pavel,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Editor INAV
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;PS - the &quot;summer&quot; contest issue is done, month and a bit late and on 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the way to the printer. Sorry for the delay - but expect to be 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;seeing it soon!

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 1. Many have asked about an electronic delivery of INAV and reasons

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; have been offered for not doing it that way. Here's an

&nbsp;&nbsp;alternative -
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; how about electronic copies for those who want it that way and paper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; copies for the others? I am presently in charge of the electronic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; distribution of my club newspaper and it takes maybe 30 seconds to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; send it out. Doing a split delivery system would obviously reduce 
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; work load and expense of getting an issue out. I would MUCH prefer 
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;an
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; electronic copy. I can store thousands of documents on my computer 
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; access them any time I need to. My copies of INAV are in bulging
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; binders that are heavy and cumbersome. A lot of times I will trust 
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;my
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; memory instead of trying to find something in my hard copies. At my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; age this is not always a good idea!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 2. I have been told many times that INAV is an all volunteer effort.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; My literal interpretation of this is that there's not supposed to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; any money left over after printing and delivery costs are paid. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; this is the case, and if electronic delivery is essentially free of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; both expense and work, why is it necessary to charge for INAV? If a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; subscriber wants to get a hard copy there could be a subscription 
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;fee
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; that would cover the costs of providing it. For those receiving an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; electonic copy it would just be a matter of asking to be on the

&nbsp;&nbsp;list.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;

<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; I would be interested in hearing both from the editors and
