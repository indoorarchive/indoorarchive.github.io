Bill et al:
<br />
<br />INAV, moving forward is going to be available for electronic delivery 
<br />
via download.  As noted on the front page of the new website 
<br />
<a href="http://www.indoornewsandviews.com/">http://www.indoornewsandviews.com/</a>:
<br />
<br />&quot;... moving forward, approximately one month after publication and 
<br />
mailing of the new paper issues, we will make electronic copies of 
<br />
the new issues available in the subscriber's only section.&quot;
<br />
<br />Any subscriber can get password, and a month after mailing, they can 
<br />
download the latest issue, as well as the back issues down to #102.  
<br />
<br />As for the subscription fee, I will give a short summary, and we plan 
<br />
to start an annual accounting in the future.  In a nutshell, yes, the 
<br />
subscription covers mailing and printing.  But Bill, from everything 
<br />
I have seen, most of our subscribers still want paper copies.  Until 
<br />
I get 150 emails/letters (we have about 200 subscribers) from folks 
<br />
saying otherwise, I think moving from hardcopy would be unfair to 
<br />
most of the subscribers.  
<br />
<br />BTW &#x2013; INAV is volunteer only, no one gets paid, or makes any money.  
<br />
In fact, the tone of that comment is right on the line of being a bit 
<br />
offensive.  Everyone who puts time into this is giving up family 
<br />
time, building/flying time, work time.  While I'm sure no offense was 
<br />
intended, I would ask that all choose their words carefully when 
<br />
making statements about the finances of INAV in the context of it 
<br />
being a volunteer run newsletter.    
<br />
<br />Second, I think $15 is very reasonable.  Yes, we tend to get the 
<br />
issues out a bit late, but they get out.  Also, we are trying to 
<br />
maintain a 40 year old tradition here.  Nothing is free, and even if 
<br />
we moved to wholly electronic (note I said &quot;if&quot;), I would still want 
<br />
to charge a subscription to maintain a website and database.  
<br />
<br />This publication is of course run and produced for the Indoor 
<br />
community, so if as I noted, 3/4 of the subscribers write in and 
<br />
request your proposed changes we would of course take that into 
<br />
serious consideration.  However, until I get a majority of 
<br />
subscribers looking for change, we will keep doing what we are doing 
<br />
and trying to put out a better newsletter each quarter.  
<br />
<br />Sincerely,
<br />
<br />Tony Pavel,
<br />
Editor INAV
<br />
<br />PS &#x2013; the &quot;summer&quot; contest issue is done, month and a bit late and on 
<br />
the way to the printer.  Sorry for the delay &#x2013; but expect to be 
<br />
seeing it soon!

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have a couple of suggestions for the INAV staff which I would like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to share with the list membership as a whole:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. Many have asked about an electronic delivery of INAV and reasons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have been offered for not doing it that way. Here's an 
</em><br />
alternative  -
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how about electronic copies for those who want it that way and paper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copies for the others? I am presently in charge of the electronic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distribution of my club newspaper and it takes maybe 30 seconds to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; send it out. Doing a split delivery system would obviously reduce 
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; work load and expense of getting an issue out. I would MUCH prefer 
</em><br />
an
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electronic copy. I can store thousands of documents on my computer 
</em><br />
and
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; access them any time I need to. My copies of INAV are in bulging
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; binders that are heavy and cumbersome. A lot of times I will trust 
</em><br />
my
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memory instead of trying to find something in my hard copies. At my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; age this is not always a good idea!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. I have been told many times that INAV is an all volunteer effort.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My literal interpretation of this is that there's not supposed to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any money left over after printing and delivery costs are paid. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is the case, and if electronic delivery is essentially free of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both expense and work, why is it necessary to charge for INAV? If a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subscriber wants to get a hard copy there could be a subscription 
</em><br />
fee
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that would cover the costs of providing it. For those receiving an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electonic copy it would just be a matter of asking to be on the 
</em><br />
list.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would be interested in hearing both from the editors and 
</em><br />
publishers
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of INAV as well as the list membership in general.
