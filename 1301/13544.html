I believe the town of Glastonbury here in Connecticut has a contractor firm
<br />
that provides all the programming services for town facilities. The college
<br />
may need to provide the re-programming information to the &quot;controllers&quot;
<br />
ahead of time. It's definitely not something I can do with a day's notice
<br />
for our gym. Maybe the college is different but I'm only giving a heads up
<br />
incase there is red tape that needs to be worked through.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Someone should at least have a good understanding of how the heating/air
<br />
conditioning system works.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;We've had indoor sessions ruined because the town forgot to let the
<br />
programmers know our time period that we were flying and the heater blowers
<br />
were running full tilt. When it's done properly, the blowers come on right
<br />
on the minute our session is officially over!

<br />If the HVAC system is monitored &amp;/or controlled by a computer system, as
<br />
most are now days, and the disconnect Sw. is opened (thrown) an alarm will
<br />
probably be indicated at the monitoring center. That could cause some
<br />
&quot;political&quot; problems. Often there is a &quot;Hand/Off/Auto&quot; switch located on the
<br />
fan starter in addition to the disconnect switch. Placing it in &quot;off&quot; might
<br />
be better that opening the disconnect switch, however, if the system is
<br />
monitored the alarm will still be triggered. The key in this situation is to
<br />
find a knowledgeable cooperative person in the maintenance or facilities
<br />
department who understands the HVAC system controls &amp; is willing to manually
<br />
over ride the fan operation or even to temporarily change the fan operating
<br />
program to stop &amp; start at specific times.

<br />
<br />Yes - there has to be a disconnect switch on the unit for when it requires
<br />
service or for an emergency. For a fan it doesn't seem there would be a
<br />
political problem in just throwing the switch.

<br />The blowers in the Glastonbury High School gym in Connecticut are remotely
<br />
programmed at a location in Atlanta, GA. I'm always reminding the town to
<br />
make sure they have re-programmed the operating times for our meets so that
<br />
everything is turned off. Any chance that the Urbana armory does the same
<br />
thing? There has to be a way to control the fans. They would have to at
<br />
least be turned off during a fire. You might have to find the right person
<br />
to talk to.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />BTW, I see Tower Hobbies is hosting an indoor R/C event at the armory on
<br />
February 9th and 10th. Might be an opportunity to at least check out the
<br />
site.

<br />
<br />Now to poke a stick at the bag. The Urbana armory is a tight place to fly.
<br />
The high point is right at the center (north-south) and the flight space is
<br />
all on an east-west line. There were fans on in both the east and west
<br />
mezzanine areas this past October (the site manager claimed that they could
<br />
not be turned off). This meant that any plane that drifted toward either
<br />
mezzanine was quickly sucked into the machinery area (both sideways and
<br />
downward!). The center area of the armory will be the prime flying space.
<br />
<br />The proposed schedule has over 14 hours of flying time for the very slow
<br />
fliers on Wednesday and another nine plus hours on Thursday. This is a great
<br />
deal of time. I suspect, though, that the best flights will be put up toward
<br />
the end of the day. Thus, the early times in the day will be much less used.
<br />
(As an aside, we will get a good experience with tight flying in July when
<br />
15 or more F1D's fight for the equally tight prime area at the Kibbie Dome
<br />
late in the rounds.)
<br />
<br />Third, the argument for F1R (formerly 35cm) that two flights are needed also
<br />
applies to F1L which, this year, will fly with the A6's, ornithopters, and
<br />
helicopters. And, by the way, an F1L is a legal EZB as well as a legal F1D
<br />
when flown with a 0.6g motor.
<br />
<br />So, perhaps Wednesday's (and Thursday's) schedule can be split perhaps
<br />
reserving the last few hours exclusively for F1D's. Also, there probably
<br />
would be no problem with having HLS's fly both days, other than the reserved
<br />
F1D time.
<br />
<br />John has done a great job finding a site (kudo's to Mike, too) and tweaking
<br />
the schedule for better flying slots both for public exposure and providing
<br />
for more participation. My comments just reflect my (limited) experience at
<br />
the site. Finally, I hope no one complains when someone flies an F1D that is
<br />
sized like an F1L on Wednesday and Thursday.
<br />
<br />Leo, and, yes, I fly F1D.
