If the HVAC system is monitored &amp;/or controlled by a computer system, as most are now days, and the disconnect Sw. is opened (thrown) an alarm will probably be indicated at the monitoring center. That could cause some &quot;political&quot; problems. Often there is a &quot;Hand/Off/Auto&quot; switch located on the fan starter in addition to the disconnect switch. Placing it in &quot;off&quot; might be better that opening the disconnect switch, however, if the system is monitored the alarm will still be triggered. The key in this situation is to find a knowledgeable cooperative person in the maintenance or facilities department who understands the HVAC system controls &amp; is willing to manually over ride the fan operation or even to temporarily change the fan operating program to stop &amp; start at specific times.

<br />Yes - there has to be a disconnect switch on the unit for when it requires service or for an emergency. For a fan it doesn't seem there would be a political problem in just throwing the switch.

<br />The blowers in the Glastonbury High School gym in Connecticutare remotely programmed at a location in Atlanta, GA. Iâ€™m alwaysreminding the town to make sure they have re-programmed the operating times forour meets so that everything is turned off. Any chance that the Urbana armorydoes the same thing? There has to be a way to control the fans. They would haveto at least be turned off during a fire. You might have to find the rightperson to talk to.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
BTW, I see Tower Hobbies is hosting an indoor R/C event at the armoryon February 9th and 10th. Might be an opportunity to at least check out the site.

<br /><br />Now to poke a stick atthe bag. The Urbana armory is a tight place to fly. The high point is right atthe center (north-south) and the flight space is all on an east-west line. Therewere fans on in both the east and west mezzanine areas this past October (thesite manager claimed that they could not be turned off). This meant that anyplane that drifted toward either mezzanine was quickly sucked into themachinery area (both sideways and downward!). The center area of the armorywill be the prime flying space.
<br />
<br />The proposed schedule has over 14 hours of flying time for the very slow flierson Wednesday and another nine plus hours on Thursday. This is a great deal oftime. I suspect, though, that the best flights will be put up toward the end ofthe day. Thus, the early times in the day will be much less used. (As an aside,we will get a good experience with tight flying in July when 15 or more F1D'sfight for the equally tight prime area at the Kibbie Dome late in the rounds.)
<br />
<br />Third, the argument for F1R (formerly 35cm) that two flights are needed alsoapplies to F1L which, this year, will fly with the A6's, ornithopters, andhelicopters. And, by the way, an F1L is a legal EZB as well as a legal F1D whenflown with a 0.6g motor.
<br />
<br />So, perhaps Wednesday's (and Thursday's) schedule can be split perhapsreserving the last few hours exclusively for F1D's. Also, there probably wouldbe no problem with having HLS's fly both days, other than the reserved F1Dtime.
<br />
<br />John has done a great job finding a site (kudo's to Mike, too) and tweaking theschedule for better flying slots both for public exposure and providing formore participation. My comments just reflect my (limited) experience at thesite. Finally, I hope no one complains when someone flies an F1D that is sizedlike an F1L on Wednesday and Thursday.
<br />
<br />Leo, and, yes, I fly F1D.
