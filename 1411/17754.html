First of all, the thinking has to expand. It's always easier to pare down,
<br />
never to go back up.
<br />
<br />Location: at least five sites, spread around the country with more around
<br />
the world.
<br />
<br />Size: at least 200 ft. Ceilings, the size of at least half of a dirigible
<br />
hangar.
<br />
<br />Maintenance: The Dutch building with residences along side or around the
<br />
space would cover financial support over the years. The only thing wrong
<br />
with the Dutch building is that it's developers didn't know about indoor
<br />
aviation when they conceived it and design for it being part of the
<br />
building's experience.
<br />
<br />Money: Crowd sourcing, I.e., Kickstarter, et al.
<br />
<br />Members: I'm doing my best - looking to the freeflight (or even the Drone
<br />
flyers (formerly known as RC flyers) is too narrow in scope. The general
<br />
public, everyone, must be the source for new enthusiasts. When my book
<br />
first came out there was a jump in indoor enthusiasm. It's now on the best
<br />
seller list at the Smithsonian's Cooper Hewitt museum. There needs to be
<br />
more of its kind and more of Float and TV and publicity for what's already
<br />
going on.
<br />
<br />Okay, there's some points to chew over. It's time for me to chew some
<br />
breakfast.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then you need someone to spearhead it, who has the right skills.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know enough about myself that I am not that person.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can lead but I don't have the marketing skills nor any experience in

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; raising funds.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This would be a full time job until it is built, of which I already

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arguably have two (job/family).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then there is the building the club around the site piece, which is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Having been in a club that imploded due to incredible lack of leadership,
