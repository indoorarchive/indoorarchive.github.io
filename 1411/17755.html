Thinking more about the Dutch building, the floor is covered with what seem
<br />
to be permanent stalls for small businesses. Tearing that out and replacing
<br />
it with a system of demountable structures would not be beyond the realm of
<br />
possibilities. Europe in general is used to weekly markets being set up and
<br />
dismantled to alter a site for alternate uses. The structures for them are
<br />
highly sophisticated. There are lots of other sports that could adapt to
<br />
and use such a shelter (chess? Hah!).
<br />
<br />The building could be zoned to house the elderly on lower floors and share
<br />
those levels with hotel space to house visiting flyers, merchants in the
<br />
markets and sports people. Dedicating the space to weekly use by flyers
<br />
would not be a problem for the flyers if they were the controlling party in
<br />
the ownership of the building. The first step might be to form a group of
<br />
investors to buy the building and then modify it to suit.
<br />
<br />It might also be a good time to capitalize on the public's recent exposure
<br />
and paranoia about drones. Put them indoors and the fear is diminished a
<br />
great deal. The indoor owners might allow them to use the space a few times
<br />
a year.
<br />
<br />Location choices in the U.S.A. or actually, anywhere, should consider the
<br />
outside weather as well. A steadily reliable climate should be a criteria
<br />
for site choice. Cloudy, rainy calm cities with lots of nerds would be good
<br />
choices. Actually, places like that also have great potential what with the
<br />
many wealthy nerds that live in them, potential investors.
<br />
<br />In parts of the country that have less stable weather patterns, well, c'est
<br />
la vie . . .
<br />
<br />If I'm not mistaken, indoor flying was a big thing on New York City during
<br />
the late thirties and for a while after WWII. Where did they fly? In the
<br />
Armories. The Armories are still there, largely empty and beautiful
<br />
potential indoor sites.
<br />
<br />Ron, the dreamer.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; First of all, the thinking has to expand. It's always easier to pare down,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never to go back up.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Location: at least five sites, spread around the country with more around
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Size: at least 200 ft. Ceilings, the size of at least half of a dirigible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hangar.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maintenance: The Dutch building with residences along side or around the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space would cover financial support over the years. The only thing wrong
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the Dutch building is that it's developers didn't know about indoor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aviation when they conceived it and design for it being part of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; building's experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Money: Crowd sourcing, I.e., Kickstarter, et al.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Members: I'm doing my best - looking to the freeflight (or even the Drone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flyers (formerly known as RC flyers) is too narrow in scope. The general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; public, everyone, must be the source for new enthusiasts. When my book
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first came out there was a jump in indoor enthusiasm. It's now on the best
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seller list at the Smithsonian's Cooper Hewitt museum. There needs to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more of its kind and more of Float and TV and publicity for what's already
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Okay, there's some points to chew over. It's time for me to chew some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; breakfast.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It's a great idea, Manuel.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'm sure you'd find many willing to donate within their means.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But where would you put it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; West Coast wouldn't help me, nor would East Coast.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Midwest - possibly, but depends upon the location.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Folks aren't going to drive six hours one way more than once a month.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (At least and stay married and connected to their children!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Then you need someone to spearhead it, who has the right skills.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I know enough about myself that I am not that person.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I can lead but I don't have the marketing skills nor any experience in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; raising funds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This would be a full time job until it is built, of which I already
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; arguably have two (job/family).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Then there is the building the club around the site piece, which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; another set of skills.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Having been in a club that imploded due to incredible lack of leadership,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; keeping them going isn't easy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; One bad apple is all it takes to turn it toxic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am not at all trying to be dismissive, throw water on the flames,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whatever. I'd support this effort as much as I could. Just pointing out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; obstacles in the path to success - I'm pretty sure the Field of Dreams,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; build it and they will come thing will not work, even if it results in a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; purpose-built indoor flying facility. There is more required, a lot more.
