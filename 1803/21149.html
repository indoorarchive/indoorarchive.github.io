Ladies and Gentlemen...
<br />
First off, let me apologize for breaking Lorbiecki's number one cardinal rule in regards to rule changes-don't comment on an event you don't fly. However, I have had to deal with things like this in every F1 class there is. My favorite class, F1C, got hit and hit hard by rule changes by people that don't fly the event. The change basically eliminated half the field from being competitive in later fly-off rounds. Probably hundreds of thousands of dollars of equipment took a hit.
<br />
I know we are not talking about this in this case, but still we could be looking at making many people not as competitive by not allowing the VP hub. The F classes are intended to be the highest technology events there are in the modeling world. F1A,B,C,D, etc have evolved with the advent of new materials and techniques and what they allow us to do. It is evolutionary and sometimes, revolutionary. It is just the nature of competition, be it models, racing, or hot dog eating. We all do this to strive to be the best.
<br />
However, we also need to get more people to play. The comment about F1B earlier was interesting but that event still has the most competition in the top 4 (A,B,C,D). People will pay to play if it is what they want. So, the cost may be deemed excessive by some but it also gives them a great chance to fly what they want and be competitive.
<br />
After attending the WC, I actually sat there thinking I should build one- and then I looked at my shaking left hand and it somewhat diminished my thoughts. But, if I did, I would probably go with a known hub and design. Being able to get a completed hub would allow me to put my efforts on the other parts of the program. And, I bet there are others thinking the same.
<br />
So, thanks to all of you working through this and I know that something good will come out of it.
<br />
