My 2 cents from a perspective of somebody who has returned to the hobby
<br />
after a 15-year pause.
<br />
When I left the F1D scene in 2002 VP was already in use for many years. In
<br />
fact, the first time it was used at a WC was in Westbaden 1980 WC by
<br />
Bernard Hunt and Dave Pym. Slowly the benefit of VP was clear, but the
<br />
adaptation of it was slow due to the 1 gram weight restriction and also the
<br />
location of the contest. VP is not particularly useful in the Salt Mines in
<br />
Slanic. I assume that the contest in Belgrade was one where a VP is a must,
<br />
I wasn't there.
<br />
When last year I inspected my 2002 models and found that they are still
<br />
flyable, I decided to start thinking about returning to F1D scene. I
<br />
remember the air in Westbaden at the 1980 WC, I made a no steer, no touch
<br />
flight of 32 minutes; I was looking forward to fly there again.
<br />
I started building new models and when it got to the propellor, things
<br />
stalled. New materials are being used and new VP designs came up that were
<br />
clearly better than the one I used in 1996 (Kibbie dome). There was just no
<br />
time to make and test them in time and buying a VP could solve that problem
<br />
for now. That allows me to inspect, study and play with a good design
<br />
before I am thinking making one myself. The 1.4 gram rule make a purchased
<br />
VP feasible, this was not possible with the old 1 gram rule.
<br />
So I learned a lot in a short time and will be ready to have my own home
<br />
built VP in the future. Personally, it is has been always my goal to build
<br />
everything myself, but would not stop others from trying or competing with
<br />
a bought VP hub.
