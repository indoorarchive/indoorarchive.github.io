&quot; For the future, why not just redefine the BOM rules to exclude VP hubs?&quot;
<br />
<br />This section of the rules does require attention.
<br />
It uses terms for which there is no definition. You are relying on
<br />
interpretation and the application of the 'spirit' of the rules.
<br />
Ten words may not be enough to fully explain what is intended.
<br />
Definition of a 'builder' includes assembly of 'parts' and 'materials' and
<br />
in some cases 'design', depending on where you look.
<br />
What's the definition of a 'part'?
<br />
Balsa, wire, tissue, adhesive and film are true materials, as they can not
<br />
be deconstructed.
<br />
But carbon sheet, rod and tube can all be 'built' - are they 'materials' or
<br />
not?
<br />
Purchased nylon screws vs threaded aluminium tube?
<br />
Rules are a very, very complex area an can create all sorts of issues...
<br />
<br />in this case a specific clause mentioning a specific item would help.
<br />
But what about VD hubs?
<br />
what about a hub bought as a kit, unassembled?
<br />
<br />If you purchase a part you will always be at a disadvantage to the maker of
<br />
that part if they compete as well.
<br />
They will have the best and latest version and they will have all the data
<br />
and understanding of developing it.
<br />
If you want to win the World Champs enough you will not be giving away any
<br />
advantage you can create.
<br />
<br />If members of the indoor competition circuit feel strongly about this issue
<br />
then there are specific ways to lodge suggestions for improvements.
<br />
<br />I believe we all want lightweight indoor duration to remain a bastion of
<br />
craftsmanship and the BOM rule underpins this.
<br />
The community is incredibly generous with all aspects of the hobby.
<br />
I've never been part of a competitive activity where openness and
<br />
collaboration are so prolific.
<br />
It's a wonderful place to be, I have been here less than a year and I've
<br />
been overwhelmed by the wealth of information shared, the donations of
<br />
materials, time and advice freely given.
<br />
<br />One thing that must be avoided when we are all contained in a tiny, tiny
<br />
niche of a niche is any loss of unity and common purpose.
<br />
The internet gives us a worldwide platform to discuss and debate progress
<br />
and it should be used for that.
<br />
<br />If you are going to the World champs I hope you all have a great time and
<br />
enjoy the flying, the friendship and the experience.
<br />
