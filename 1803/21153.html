Edmund,
<br />
<br />The model must free itself which to me means no outside influences. So 
<br />
my responses would be as follows
<br />
<br />1) timing stops as the pilot freed the model, it did not free itself
<br />
2) timing stops as the model did not free itself, the pilot created air 
<br />
currents to free the model
<br />
3) timing stops as it did not free itself, same as if the pilot dislodged
<br />
4) Once a model hangs it becomes part of the &quot;building&quot; like a light 
<br />
fixture is part of the building. So you can steer from it but if you 
<br />
hang on it then no re-flight.
<br />
5) No reflight for the model that collides with an already hung up model 
<br />
as a hung model becomes part of the building once hung. Also a midair 
<br />
collision I think by definition means both planes are flying. I would 
<br />
not call a flying plane that hit a stationary plane a midair collision, 
<br />
they would both need to be in the act of flying.
<br />
<br />I think I may know where these last few questions are coming from. A 
<br />
friend of mine (who was an official timer) ask me a couple days ago why 
<br />
did John Kagan get a re-flight when his model was hung on another model? 
<br />
The answer is simple, he did not get a reflight because his model hung 
<br />
on another model. He got a reflight because earlier in the same flight 
<br />
his model had a midair with another plane but luckily they both came 
<br />
loose from each other and kept flying. The person I was talking to had 
<br />
no idea that a midair happened earlier in the flight (the actual reason 
<br />
why John was allowed a reflight). My friend had incorrectly assumed the 
<br />
reflight was being allowed because Johns model became hung on another 
<br />
model and John was somehow using the midair collision rule as a way to 
<br />
get a reflight. That is not the reason why he received a reflight. 
<br />
Hopefully that clears it up for others who may have been having the same 
<br />
question on John's reflight. I was not aware there was some confusion 
<br />
about his reflight as I knew what happened but I can see how people can 
<br />
think exactly what my friend did since he did not know all the details 
<br />
on that flight.
