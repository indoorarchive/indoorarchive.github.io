<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
I fully agree with Leo here. Buying a  VP hub is not a shortcut to F1D 
<br />
success, and anyone capable of building the model can build the hub 
<br />
also. I have been giving courses of building F1M models (hopefully my 
<br />
students will eventually move on to F1D - some already have), and while 
<br />
the models were flying and in trim almost right off the building board, 
<br />
not so with the VP's. I have tried to tell them that it took me a year 
<br />
or more to master my first VP, and only with the experience gained with 
<br />
that I have been able to adjust my later props in a shorter time. Maybe 
<br />
a bought hub would have the spring &quot;right&quot; readily, but short of that 
<br />
you just need to take your time tweaking the prop to build the 
<br />
understanding on how the VP needs to be adjusted. That insight you 
<br />
cannot buy.
<br />
<br />So, you may ask, why am I then opposing allowing bought VP hubs for F1D? 
<br />
The reason is in principle. Allowing to buy the one most critical 
<br />
component of the model is a &quot;wet blanket on the face&quot; for the BOM rule. 
<br />
To me it is like saying that &quot;you must use your seat belt while driving, 
<br />
but not for trips shorter than 100 miles&quot;. Allowing built VP's is like 
<br />
saying &quot;in F1D you must build you own models, except you do not need 
<br />
to&quot;. Allowing bought VP's will not make F1D any more popular (as the VP 
<br />
is not that hard to build), but banning them send a message that BOM 
<br />
rule stands.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we want to increase the size of F1D entrant pool in the US 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (recognizing that the F1D class in the US is often the largest class 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at many indoor contests), we need to do two things.  First, we need to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a way for people to get started in F1D without getting frustrated 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by how hard it is to fly an early in the learn! ing and building 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process F1D.  To that goal, beginners need to build a first (or second 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and third) F1D that can fly well and is sturdy enough to last.
</em><br />
<br />I have said this before, and will say again: F1M is an excellent 
<br />
stepping stone towards F1D. The models are large enough to fly well, and 
<br />
when they use the same size of props than F1D's but at slightly higher 
<br />
RPM (my models turn ~80rpm), they can even be safely flown in the same 
<br />
airspace as F1D, without risking damaging the lighter ships in 
<br />
collision. F1M can be built with hobbyshop balsa (good indoor balsa 
<br />
makes easier to build the motor tubes, but even those can be built of 
<br />
sanded-down hobbyshop stuff. For the rest of the model, hobbyshop wood 
<br />
is A-ok). 1 micron film, cheaply available e.g. from Mike Woodhouse is 
<br />
light enough for covering, and the models are sturdy enough to be 
<br />
handled by beginners. At the same time, F1M models have limited motor 
<br />
weight and utilise VP props, so they teach the beginners all the 
<br />
essential features of indoor flying before the move onto F1D. I have 
<br />
given several courses on building various F1M designs (first penny-plane 
<br />
style novice version, then full-sized tandem models), on the latest 
<br />
course we had a dozen attendants, and most of them built and trimmed 
<br />
their model over a weekend. Of that dozen, three guys have since moved 
<br />
over to F1D... so I think that is a good path to introduce people to F1D 
<br />
flying.
