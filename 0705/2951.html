Someone sent this to me, and I had to pass it along.  Wrong hobby - 
<br />
but I think we can all relate, as can our families.

<br />Model-Train Hobby Becomes Model-Train Habit
<br />
<br />BILLINGS, MT&#x2014;Though he insists he can handle it, Leon Gehr's model-
<br />
train pastime has crossed the line from hobby to habit, Gehr family 
<br />
sources reported Monday. 
<br />
<br />Model-train addict Leon Gehr poses with his stash.
<br />
&quot;Leon just isn't the same person anymore,&quot; said Penny Gehr, 48, 
<br />
Leon's wife of 21 years. &quot;All he ever thinks about is where he's 
<br />
going to get his next few feet of nickel silver snap-together track. 
<br />
It's all-consuming. I want my husband back.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;I'd been dabbling in die-cast metal cars for years, and then one 
<br />
day, about three years ago, I thought to myself, 'Boy, it sure would 
<br />
be fun if these cars could run,'&quot; said a glassy-eyed Gehr, his arms 
<br />
covered with railroad-track marks. &quot;The fella at the hobby store said 
<br />
to me, 'What you want is a model railroad.' From that day forward, I 
<br />
was hooked. Now, I'm a big railhead.&quot; 
<br />
<br />When Gehr first began dabbling in model trains, his family wasn't 
<br />
terribly concerned, confident he could handle it. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Dad experimented for years with cars and even model airplanes, so I 
<br />
didn't think a whole lot of it,&quot; said Cory, his 19-year-old son. &quot;It 
<br />
was always a weekend thing, something he did for kicks. If I'd only 
<br />
known what the model trains would do to him, how addictive they are, 
<br />
I would have organized an intervention long ago.&quot; 
<br />
<br />For the first two and a half years, Gehr's model-railroad use 
<br />
appeared to be under control. Eventually, however, the trains began 
<br />
to take over. 
<br />
<br />&quot;At first, Leon would buy just a flatbed here or a tanker there. But 
<br />
then, it started to pick up,&quot; Penny said. &quot;Before long, he was 
<br />
doubling the number of cars he was bringing home, then tripling. 
<br />
Without us knowing it, he'd crossed the Rock Island line.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Leon and I used to grab a beer or watch a ballgame together,&quot; friend 
<br />
Jason Gammon said. &quot;At some point, he gave all that up and just 
<br />
withdrew into his own world&#x2014;one on a 1:48 scale.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Last winter, Gehr converted his family's basement rec room into a 
<br />
maze of twisting tracks and miniature houses. He began to stay up 
<br />
until all hours of the night gluing branches onto miniature trees. On 
<br />
more than one occasion, he was late to work because of his habit, 
<br />
sleeping through his ringing alarm clock after staying up until 2 
<br />
a.m. on a bridge-painting binge. 
<br />
<br />The breaking point came two weekends ago, when Gehr drove six hours 
<br />
to the Montana Model Railroad Association convention in Missoula. 
<br />
<br />&quot;I begged him not to go, but he wouldn't listen,&quot; Penny said. &quot;He 
<br />
said he had to find a Lionel Pennsylvania Flyer Train Set Model 6-
<br />
3191 and that he'd do anything for it. He slipped out when I was 
<br />
still asleep and left a note saying he wanted to 'get an early 
<br />
start.'&quot; 
<br />
<br />The back of the note, however, painted an even more disturbing 
<br />
picture. In the frenzied scrawl of a man possessed were written the 
<br />
words, &quot;Precision can motor / Transformer controlled forward / 
<br />
Neutral and reverse / Operating headlight and puffing smoke unit / 
<br />
Detailed molded tender body with stamped metal frame and operating 
<br />
air whistle. Must get 40-WATT TRANSFORMER!!!&quot; 
<br />
<br />The night after he left, Penny received a call from her husband, who 
<br />
said he'd decided to stay the night in Missoula. When he finally got 
<br />
home 36 hours later, his eyes were bloodshot and he'd blown more than 
<br />
$600 on Bachmann O-scale Cityscenes building kits. 
<br />
<br />&quot;I finally gave him an ultimatum,&quot; Penny said. &quot;I said, 'Either the 
<br />
model trains go or I go.'&quot; 
<br />
<br />Even when threatened with losing his wife, Leon continued to deny he 
<br />
has a problem. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Penny likes to give me the business about how much money I spend on 
<br />
these trains, but what she doesn't realize is that they're an 
<br />
investment,&quot; Gehr said. &quot;I could make some real money someday if I 
<br />
ever decided to turn around and start selling.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;I just know he's going to do something stupid and get in way over 
<br />
his head. He's going to throw away everything he's worked so hard 
<br />
for,&quot; Penny said. &quot;That Sam Gilchrist is the one I blame for this.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Gilchrist, who works at the East Towne Mall's Hobby Haven, introduced 
<br />
Gehr to model railroading. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Sam and the others who hang out at the hobby shop all day have 
<br />
dragged Leon down into the dirt with them,&quot; Penny said. &quot;Now, my 
<br />
husband is a train careening out of control.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Unbeknownst to Penny, Gilchrist recently informed Gehr that he has a 
<br />
job waiting for him at Hobby Haven if he ever wants it. 
<br />
<br />&quot;If I worked at the Hobby Haven, I could just hang out and talk to 
<br />
people about trains all day,&quot; Gehr said. &quot;I know it sounds crazy, but 
<br />
I could make a lot of money working on commission. Plus, I'd get the 
<br />
employee discount. And if I ever did get tired of it, I know I could 
<br />
quit any time.&quot;
