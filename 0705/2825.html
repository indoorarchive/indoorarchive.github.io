Hi Gary,
<br />
<br />Against my better judgement, let me offer some explaination (personal 
<br />
opinion).
<br />
<br />You apparently have a science background and have spent a lot of time 
<br />
thinking about various aspects of Indoor FF, as you know it.  The 
<br />
ideas you describe sound like they might have merit for optimizing 
<br />
one area or another.
<br />
<br />The problem is that if you aren't familiar with types of planes we 
<br />
fly, you run the risk of optimizing an area that might not produce 
<br />
much overall benefit.  Not that that's a problem by itself - we all 
<br />
do it an learn from it.  But if you present your theories as though 
<br />
you already know what works and doesn't - or even know what the real 
<br />
question is - it can confuse those trying to learn, and it rubs 
<br />
people the wrong way.
<br />
<br />Your statement that you didn't know an AMA Cub and a Dandiflyer 
<br />
weren't indoor planes is telling.  They certainly are planes that can 
<br />
be flown indoors, but their challenges just as certainly aren't much 
<br />
like the &quot;real&quot; (for lack of a better term)indoor planes we fly.
<br />
<br />I'm pretty sure that's what Mark B is trying to goad you into 
<br />
realizing.  Once you start flying a Limited Pennyplane, EZB, F1L, 
<br />
F1D, etc., you will begin seeing the real variables waiting to be 
<br />
tweaked.  You'll also likely find that 99.999% of them are already 
<br />
known quite well and have pretty decent solutions.
<br />
<br />Of course, there is always the .001% that may actually make a 
<br />
difference, and that's why I don't just simply dismiss your efforts.  
<br />
There could be valuable needle in that haystack.  But without much 
<br />
understanding of the problem domain, you are severely handicaping 
<br />
your chances of matching a solution with a significant problem.
<br />
<br />So, consider helping yourself and helping us by getting to know the 
<br />
kinds of planes we are talking about.  Forget about all the ways you 
<br />
are going to improve them initially, and just build and fly one.  
<br />
You'll make your Bill-Nye-the-Science-Guy vibe more credible and, 
<br />
best of all, it is a heck of a lot of fun.
<br />
<br />P.S. It is practically cliche for a newcomer to think they are going 
<br />
to figure out one big thing and suddenly fly better than everyone 
<br />
else.  One person I showed my planes to decided that eliminating the 
<br />
knot in the rubber motor was the silver bullet.  He never actually 
<br />
built a plane, but if he had I would have bet the kids college fund 
<br />
that his &quot;no-knot&quot; motor wouldn't produce much benefit - nevermind 
<br />
compensate for all the other things he didn't know.
<br />
