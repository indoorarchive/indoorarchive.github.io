<br />
Tim, Fred and Martin: I apreciate very much your help.
<br />
<br />I will first reply Fred, because he is asking some important 
<br />
details that I have missed to post:
<br />
<br /><br />1) Are you getting to the top of the site?
<br />
Yes, but giving a full load, only touching one or two times.
<br />
In a 30 meters ceiling I will be in problems to reach the top.
<br />
<br />2) Do you use up all of the turns?
<br />
Yes, almost all
<br />
<br />3) If not how many turns are left?
<br />
Always less than 10%, usually 5% left (50 out of 1100)
<br />
<br />4)What is your average rpm?
<br />
Arround 48 RPM
<br />
<br />5) What is your cruising rpm?
<br />
Not sure about this, I will check on next flights.
<br />
<br />6)What batch and size is your rubber?
<br />
Tan II 5/99, average 1.35mm x 210mm (0.053&quot; x  8.26&quot;)
<br />
<br />7)What is your prop pitch and diameter?
<br />
Propeller is 19&quot; x 30&quot;, S. Brown design.
<br />
<br />8)What does your plane weigh?
<br />
Depending on several configurations (changing wings, 
<br />
stab, etc) the weight is between 1250mg to 1300mg in 
<br />
the way it keeps stiff.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You should be able to get more turns and torque out of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; motors, as Tim said 9.5&quot; of even lesser batches motor should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; give up to 50% or more turns than you stated, and .45 to 5
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in oz of torque should be attainable. Even supersport should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take more turns 
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I can add some more turns (an more torque), but not much 
<br />
more because I'm using a bigger cross section. 
<br />
<br />My model can't handle 0.45 in-oz!! It will be destroyed :)
<br />
Do you launch with 0.45 ~ 0.50 in-oz??
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;unless you are using a large cross section motor. 
</em><br />
<br />You are right
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Any motor with a broken in length of less than 9&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pretty large cross section and if you need motors that big
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you might have to make some changes to your prop and or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model trim.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                  Fred Tellier
</em><br />
<br />Again you are right, but what are the tests I have to do
<br />
to determine if I have to build a new model, less draggy
<br />
or start working in a propeller?
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Now Tim:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. Check your spar deflection- Your spars need to be pretty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strong as if they are too soft, they will deflect too much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causing the plane to climb a lot less than it really can. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are already hitting the ceiling anyway, then soft spars
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may actually help a little. On indoorduration.com theres a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole article about F1D type props by Steve Brown.
</em><br />
<br />Do you mean the prop spars deflection? Or wing spars?  Any
<br />
case i think they are ok, both spars (prop and wings) are
<br />
pretty strong.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. Rubber- I think its one of the most important aspects. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you don't have the super rubber (5/99, 8/93, etc.) then the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times over 30 min can be difficult to achieve. 
</em><br />
Rubber seems not be the problem since I have some good 99 and 93
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You said you were only getting around 1000 turns at .35 in/oz.? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What size rubber are you using and what batch? 
</em><br />
<br />Sorry, thats because my poor english.. I mean with those
<br />
numbers the launch turns and torque. Im using a big section
<br />
and model can handle up to .35 in-oz. Of course I can wind
<br />
more turns and higer torque in a stooge , but not for my
<br />
model.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; At Kibbie Dome last year, 5/99 .049-.050 x 9.4&quot;-9.5&quot; was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; getting about 1600-1700 turns at a max torque of about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; .45-.47 in/oz.. The good stuff has a huge difference.
</em><br />
<br />Wow, well I can put 1600 turns in a .049- 9.5&quot;, then back
<br />
turns to reduce torque, but my model will not climb and it
<br />
will land with lots of turns.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. Check your downthrust (especially during launch) and your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thrust line. If you have too much, the plane won't go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anywhere. Typically, having no downthrust without the stress
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the rubber is pretty good. If the plane stalls on launch,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can adjust the tension of the bracing wire so that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rubber tension makes the motorstick bow a little- adding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; downthrust.
</em><br />
<br />This is not the problem, at least with the torque im using.
<br />
It clims with a good angle, not stalls not dive. Anyway is
<br />
an excellent tip!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There's a lot more things to look for when flying F1D or any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other class of planes, but these steps may help to increase
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your time!  Hope this helps and ask questions if you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                      Tim Chang
</em><br />
<br />Thanks Tim, well sure it will help, and please keep going the
<br />
good tips. Its very hard to learn from a book or via email.
<br />
Here, in Argentina, there are too few people doing F1D and
<br />
we are all in a nebulose.
<br />
<br />It will be priceless to see you guys flying in a world or
<br />
national contest. For now, i keep bothering you with
<br />
questions.  :)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Now Martin:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; How many models have you made? Model making is like anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; else,with practice you get better at it. Did you struggle to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get to weight?  Are you close to weight? You quickly learn
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that weight isn't the most important thing. The model has to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be strong and stiff enough. If you struggled to get to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weight you might have the weight in the wrong places.
</em><br />
<br />Six, but from all thos I saved 3 models, the stiffer was the
<br />
selection criteria, then weight, almost there (~5% overweight)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You say you have problems getting the turns in. Do you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stretch wind?  Do you use lube? The better flyers know how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to pack in the turns. Like building, it really pays to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; practice winding, or at least do a lot of winding.
</em><br />
<br />Martin, I explained above why the low turns. Yes, I strech wind.
<br />
Lube is 5000 cts silicone. And you are right, probably I need to
<br />
pack better the turns and practice winding.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Don't be discouraged. 
</em><br />
Yes, still fighting :)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The guys with the great times have been doing this for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; while now, or have mentors with a lot of experience. Even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the experienced guys the times didn't start out nearly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as high as they have gone. Folks had to learn what works
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the &quot;new&quot; rules. We benefit from their hard work, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is a lot that goes into a sucessful indoor model.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Good luck.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Marty Sasaki
</em><br />
<br /><br />Sure, but how to do the step from 20 minutes to 30 minutes?
<br />
Will be incredably to have a mentor, but we are 8000 miles
<br />
away.  If any of you travel to argentina, we have exelent
<br />
&quot;Asado&quot; to pay with :)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />All above said, hope you can helpme with this 2 
<br />
two questions that are breaking my head:
<br />
<br />1) How do I know if I have to focus my work on propellers or trying to
<br />
reduce drag by triming?
<br />
<br />2) What will be the &quot;terical&quot; or &quot;ideal&quot; propeller size (S. brown
<br />
design) to be  used with a 0.49-9.5&quot; 5/99 rubber?
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Regards! 
<br />
<br />Ignacio
