&quot;So, you found a Sympo article full of someone's theoretical suggestions,  
<br />
but it didn't prove correct when compared with your flying notes.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;John A. Gard, designer of Monarch, Lazy Bones and Supreme...builder since  
<br />
the thirties...USAF WWII...FAI enthusiast since '54...1st '62 Nats Wake...5th  
<br />
'69 Wakefield WC...written articles on rubber model performance and conducted  
<br />
research and controlled flight testing to correlate measured with predicted  
<br />
data...BSAeroE, StL U '48...thirty three years structural analysis aircraft,  
<br />
helicopters, missiles and spacecraft...&quot; it says in the Sympo.  He used  
<br />
flight data provided by George Batiuk, Jack Brown, Joe Foster, Chris Matsuno,  
<br />
Robert Piserchio, Jim Quinn and Robert White to calculate prop  efficiencies.  The 
<br />
study focused on Wakefield propellers, which require a  high efficiency 
<br />
during the initial power burst to maximize altitude.  We  have a slightly different 
<br />
problem.  I independently developed the same  method, but put a warning flag 
<br />
next to one of the assumptions.  When I  got my flight test data, I went 
<br />
beyond just the propeller efficiency  calculation, used the data to check that 
<br />
assumption and found it was not  good.  The aerodynamic characteristics of the 
<br />
wing were not the same in  glide and under power.  In particular, the lift 
<br />
coefficient was much higher  than I would ever expect it to be.  This can 
<br />
significantly alter the  sinking speed, violating one of the (unstated) assumptions of 
<br />
the method.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;BTW, any official times I report will be timed by someone else.  This  is 
<br />
not part of the Postal rules, and obviously I can't insist on you doing the  
<br />
same, but it would be nice.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I intend to ask someone else to time my flights.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;BTW, would be interesting to see a picture of your foot stooge/cuphook  
<br />
model holder hooked around the prop spar of your LPP while you stretch out the  
<br />
rubber for winding, if I understand your system correctly.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I was intending on doing that, too.  I uploaded pictures of the stooge  and 
<br />
its use in winding the Dandiflyer to the Tools file of the Photos  section.  
<br />
Using a cup hook is a good idea.  They would be a lot easier  to make that way.
<br />
<br />&quot;How many strands do you intend to braid for your LPP  motor?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I intend to use a two strand motor.  The exact details must await  initial 
<br />
flight performance tests of the airplane and propeller.  I was  going to test 
<br />
braided motors on the Dandiflyer, but I might as well do it here  where I 
<br />
suspect it will have a stronger motivation.  My current Dandiflyer  motor is only a 
<br />
bit more than twice the hook distance, and indications are that  the next 
<br />
iteration will be about an inch shorter.  The LPP motor looks like  it may be a 
<br />
lot longer in proportion.  The decision whether to use braiding  or not will 
<br />
come after the flight tests tell me the best section and length of  motor to use.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I expect I will be making a full written report after the contest.
<br />
