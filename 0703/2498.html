Mark,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Since your theory is all about efficiency and assumes that maintaining  
<br />
highest efficiency also delivers the highest TIME, I think you should have to  
<br />
stick to a non flaring prop for this experiment.  Is not a high flaring  prop, 
<br />
which presumably flares away from the pitch it was formed to, generally  accepted 
<br />
as somewhat less efficient than a (reasonably pitched) non flaring  prop, all 
<br />
other things equal? 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
You will have seen my request to the CD for rule clarification on this  
<br />
point.  That clarification may make this discussion moot.  I don't  know enough 
<br />
about props yet to give an opinion.  I won't have time  preparing for this 
<br />
contest to undertake extensive prop development.  But if  I find any indication that 
<br />
changing the pitch, up or down, by flare, will  improve the efficiency, I 
<br />
will give it a try.  I expect that, except for  unintended flaring at launch, my 
<br />
prop blades will be rigid by intent.   Without time to test prop theories, I 
<br />
will be proceeding on certain simple  assumptions, including initially a rigid 
<br />
blade.  Right now I don't even  know what the prop will look like, whether it 
<br />
would be capable of flaring.   I do know that I will not be using positive 
<br />
flaring with the intention  of controlling RPM.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
All other things are never equal.  ;-)  Changing one thing  usually affects 
<br />
many other things.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;So how will you KNOW what is more &quot;efficient?&quot;  &quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Since we are involved in a contest, rather than a lab experiment, that has  
<br />
to remain my secret, at least until the contest is over.  ;-)  I  will give you 
<br />
a hint.  The published method does not work.  I tried  it.  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
And after that, you may discover that a less efficient, heavier motor  
<br />
swinging a bigger hammer less efficiently, can lead to more TIME.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
If I discover that, I will let you know right away.  That is the whole  point 
<br />
of the experiment.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Oh, please, please innovate a better prop, at least if measured by  time.  I 
<br />
will gladly copy it, fly with it, and give you the  credit.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Some of my ideas have to do with constructing the prop, attaching it  to the 
<br />
plane and testing it.  Some of that may result in a more efficient  prop, the 
<br />
indirect effect of which will be a longer time.
<br />
<br />Agreed.  So get your model trimmed with your rubber, and I  will then mail 
<br />
you a few grams of the rubber I intend to use, 7/97 Tan II.   It should only 
<br />
give you more cruise, and not wreck all your  equations.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Thank you for the generous offer.  I warn you that I burn rubber  as fuel.  
<br />
;-)  To optimize the motor I need a torque curve derived  under conditions that 
<br />
match flight use, requiring at least two test specimens,  and flight test 
<br />
data from at least two flights in one of which the motor will be  essentially 
<br />
destroyed.  I may be able to use flight test data from my 2/99  Tan II in 
<br />
combination with a torque curve from your 7/97 Tan II to size the  motor.  It would 
<br />
make better sense to test both methods using the same  rubber on the same plane 
<br />
under the same ceiling.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I generally like to have two or three motors, because many flights are not  
<br />
completed successfully.  I did a flight last week that looked like it might  
<br />
break my previous best and the plane landed in a basketball hoop.  Two  points!  
<br />
On another possible record breaker, four boys ran under the plane  and their 
<br />
wake upset the wing, producing a sideslip into the ground.  One  of my best 
<br />
early flights was made after the motor hook pulled out and  disappeared, 
<br />
catapulted by the fully wound motor.  I stuck a straight pin  in the stick, wound the 
<br />
motor back up and flew.  The process of gathering  data can be very messy.
<br />
<br />Your footstooge that holds a prop by its hub, stretched against the  rubber 
<br />
for winding will not work with LPP, of course.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Actually, I have used the footstooge to wind the EZ Penny.  Worked  fine.  
<br />
May not work for this one, though.  We'll see.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I spent a pleasant hour going through my boxes of kits collected during  
<br />
those decades when I was too busy  and became a kit collector rather than a  
<br />
builder and flyer.  I found four Penny Plane kits that may be built to LPP  
<br />
specification.  I will need to build a more sensitive balance than the  decigram 
<br />
balance I now use and  torque curve for my rubber.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Welcome to Indoor as we know it.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Thank you.  I've been here for a while.  Now that I am retired, I  hope to 
<br />
spend a lot more time in the Gym.  There is so much to learn.
<br />
