It sounds like you need more turns, and you need to improve your winding techniques I sometimes use the size of rubber you are using in Cat 1 sites and can get 1300 or more turns in it at .55 in oz. I would wind harder and back off to a launch torque your plane can handle. A couple hundred more turns will by you another 4 to 5 minutes without changing anything with your plane. Are you sure your pitch is 30&quot; your RPM seems low with that low of pitch. 
<br />
Are you sure your motor sticks cannot take more torque, if they can't for sure that should be your next building goal higher sites will need more launch torque.
<br />
<br />The rubber testing program I use is also a good tool for improving your winding skills it will run in MS Excel and is not hard to use. It can be downloaded off my cloubuster web page or I can send it as an attachment to a off list email to you.
<br />
I would put my time into propellers, winding skills and stronger motor sticks.
<br />
<br />Good luck
<br />

<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Tim, Fred and Martin: I apreciate very much your help.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first reply Fred, because he is asking some important 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;details that I have missed to post:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Are you getting to the top of the site?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but giving a full load, only touching one or two times.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In a 30 meters ceiling I will be in problems to reach the top.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Do you use up all of the turns?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, almost all
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;3) If not how many turns are left?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Always less than 10%, usually 5% left (50 out of 1100)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;4)What is your average rpm?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Arround 48 RPM
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;5) What is your cruising rpm?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not sure about this, I will check on next flights.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;6)What batch and size is your rubber?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tan II 5/99, average 1.35mm x 210mm (0.053&quot; x 8.26&quot;)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;7)What is your prop pitch and diameter?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Propeller is 19&quot; x 30&quot;, S. Brown design.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;8)What does your plane weigh?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on several configurations (changing wings, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;stab, etc) the weight is between 1250mg to 1300mg in 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the way it keeps stiff.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; You should be able to get more turns and torque out of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; motors, as Tim said 9.5&quot; of even lesser batches motor should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; give up to 50% or more turns than you stated, and .45 to 5
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; in oz of torque should be attainable. Even supersport should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; take more turns 
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I can add some more turns (an more torque), but not much 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;more because I'm using a bigger cross section. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My model can't handle 0.45 in-oz!! It will be destroyed :)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you launch with 0.45 ~ 0.50 in-oz??
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt;unless you are using a large cross section motor. 
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You are right
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Any motor with a broken in length of less than 9&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; pretty large cross section and if you need motors that big
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; you might have to make some changes to your prop and or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; model trim.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Fred Tellier
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Again you are right, but what are the tests I have to do
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to determine if I have to build a new model, less draggy
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;or start working in a propeller?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Tim:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 1. Check your spar deflection- Your spars need to be pretty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; strong as if they are too soft, they will deflect too much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; causing the plane to climb a lot less than it really can. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; you are already hitting the ceiling anyway, then soft spars
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; may actually help a little. On indoorduration.com theres a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; whole article about F1D type props by Steve Brown.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you mean the prop spars deflection? Or wing spars? Any
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;case i think they are ok, both spars (prop and wings) are
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;pretty strong.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 2. Rubber- I think its one of the most important aspects. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; you don't have the super rubber (5/99, 8/93, etc.) then the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; times over 30 min can be difficult to achieve. 
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubber seems not be the problem since I have some good 99 and 93
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; You said you were only getting around 1000 turns at .35 in/oz.? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; What size rubber are you using and what batch? 
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, thats because my poor english.. I mean with those
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;numbers the launch turns and torque. Im using a big section
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and model can handle up to .35 in-oz. Of course I can wind
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;more turns and higer torque in a stooge , but not for my
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;model.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; At Kibbie Dome last year, 5/99 .049-.050 x 9.4&quot;-9.5&quot; was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; getting about 1600-1700 turns at a max torque of about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; .45-.47 in/oz.. The good stuff has a huge difference.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow, well I can put 1600 turns in a .049- 9.5&quot;, then back
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;turns to reduce torque, but my model will not climb and it
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;will land with lots of turns.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 3. Check your downthrust (especially during launch) and your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; thrust line. If you have too much, the plane won't go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; anywhere. Typically, having no downthrust without the stress
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; of the rubber is pretty good. If the plane stalls on launch,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; you can adjust the tension of the bracing wire so that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; rubber tension makes the motorstick bow a little- adding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; downthrust.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the problem, at least with the torque im using.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;It clims with a good angle, not stalls not dive. Anyway is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;an excellent tip!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; There's a lot more things to look for when flying F1D or any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; other class of planes, but these steps may help to increase
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; your time! Hope this helps and ask questions if you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; any.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Tim Chang
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks Tim, well sure it will help, and please keep going the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;good tips. Its very hard to learn from a book or via email.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, in Argentina, there are too few people doing F1D and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;we are all in a nebulose.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be priceless to see you guys flying in a world or
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;national contest. For now, i keep bothering you with
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;questions. :)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Martin:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; How many models have you made? Model making is like anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; else,with practice you get better at it. Did you struggle to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; get to weight? Are you close to weight? You quickly learn
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; that weight isn't the most important thing. The model has to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; be strong and stiff enough. If you struggled to get to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; weight you might have the weight in the wrong places.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Six, but from all thos I saved 3 models, the stiffer was the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;selection criteria, then weight, almost there (~5% overweight)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; You say you have problems getting the turns in. Do you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; stretch wind? Do you use lube? The better flyers know how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; to pack in the turns. Like building, it really pays to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; practice winding, or at least do a lot of winding.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin, I explained above why the low turns. Yes, I strech wind.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lube is 5000 cts silicone. And you are right, probably I need to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;pack better the turns and practice winding.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt;Don't be discouraged. 
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, still fighting :)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; The guys with the great times have been doing this for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; while now, or have mentors with a lot of experience. Even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; for the experienced guys the times didn't start out nearly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; as high as they have gone. Folks had to learn what works
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; with the &quot;new&quot; rules. We benefit from their hard work, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; there is a lot that goes into a sucessful indoor model.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Good luck.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Marty Sasaki
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, but how to do the step from 20 minutes to 30 minutes?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will be incredably to have a mentor, but we are 8000 miles
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;away. If any of you travel to argentina, we have exelent
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Asado&quot; to pay with :)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;All above said, hope you can helpme with this 2 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;two questions that are breaking my head:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;1) How do I know if I have to focus my work on propellers or trying to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;reduce drag by triming?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;2) What will be the &quot;terical&quot; or &quot;ideal&quot; propeller size (S. brown
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;design) to be used with a 0.49-9.5&quot; 5/99 rubber?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Regards! 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignacio
