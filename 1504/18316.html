Kent is over and done and it was a great time.  There was some good flying and good comradery from both the AMA fliers and FAC fliers.  If you know people who fly outdoor FAC but are afraid to try indoor, invite them to a local indoor meet.  They are great fun. 
<br />
<br />Now for a &quot;Chris-centric&quot; report on the flying.  I say that because I was mostly paying attention  to events I was flying and things goi g on around me.  Leo P and Larry Louka put on a great show in F1L with Leo winning the event with (IIRC) two flights over 15 mins.  LPP was well contested with several fliers putting in flights around  and over 10 mins.  In the end, Bill Gowen won the event with a 10:36.  I came in second with a personal best 10:30, and third was in the high 9's.  F1D had fewer than usual fliers, but that doesn't mean there was any less excitement in that event.  Kang Lee set a Cat 2 record of 22:14 on Saturday.  Jim Richmond broke that record on his first flight with his model on Sunday.  Kang then missed the record by one second.  The real excitement of the weekend, at least for me was junior flyer Logan Noel.  I have been mentoring this young man since November.  His first model was a double whammy, his second was anF1L, then an A6, and finally, a LPP that did double duty as an F1M.  He flew his A6 and established the Cat2 junior record of 5:26.  His F1L did a best time of 11:25 on a nerve wracking, ceiling scrubbing flight, which sets a new Jr. Record.  His LPP/F1M model flown as an F1M did 7:34 to establish the Jr record in that class.  Logan has been working really hard, and has done great as a first year builder/flier.  He is very much into model flying, and I think we will continue to see great things from him.
<br />
<br />That's it from me.  Thanks to the CFFS and all competitors for making the 2015 Kent contest a great time.
<br />
<br />Chris G
