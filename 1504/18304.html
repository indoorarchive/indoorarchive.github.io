Vlad,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're planning to fly FAC scale here in the US, I've got a few simple thoughts that have been successful in getting me near maximum static marks even with less than perfect building skills.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;1. The rulebook says you need a 3-view and photos. Before building any scale model, do a google search and find those items. If you can't find them, select a different airplane.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;2. Reality is that the 3-view is only there to prove that you didn't significantly fudge the shape of the airplane. Make a note in *red* on the 3-view page of your documentation packet that says that the 3-view is there only for layout reference so as to remind the scale judge how FAC judging is supposed to occur (I've had some forget--since I started including this note, my scores have gone up).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;3. 100% of your actual scale detailing should come from photos. If you have to refer back to a 3-view or engineering drawing for a particular detail, include as much proof as possible that it's correct. It should be clear enough for a 5 year old to understand it because you're not going to be around to answer any questions from the scale judge.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;4. Get the highest resolution photos you can find. Show those photos in a color/markings section with any important markings pointed out.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;5. Now take your high resolution photos and arrange them out in a &quot;details/workmanship&quot; section. Circle every single detail in a bright color with an arrow to a callout saying what that part is. *Every* detail should be pointed out. Now, everything that you've pointed out should appear on your airplane. That means control horns, steps, tie-down loops, gun sights, etc. Rib stitching will get you little to nothing; same for scale rib spacing and rivets (notice the &quot;little to nothing&quot; bit -- it is possible to get a little for those details in some cases because it may improve the mood of the judge, and no I'm not kidding). All of these details can be included at minimal weight penalty if done right, and they don't even have to be done well. Merely having them at all is 90% of your score for the &quot;details/workmanship&quot; section. Lastly, even though the rulebook specifically says it does not count as part of your score, ALWAYS paint your prop in a scale manner and add a scale-looking hub. It's not supposed to count, but I can assure you that your score will improve if you do this because a scale-looking prop blends in, which a non-scale one looks out of place and draws the judge's attention away from your carefully detailed airplane. The same goes for noseblocks with scads of shims attached to them. Go the extra mile an include an adjustable thrust button, or do what I do, which is to shim everything the out, and then build up the rest of the nose around those shims with soft balsa after the model is trimmed, sand and blend it all in, and then re-cover that area with tissue so that it just blends into the structure of the aircraft. Looks great and no one will even notice your canted nose.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;6. Somewhere in your documentation packet, you need to have a breakdown of any bonus points your model receives. Do the math for the judge so he doesn't have to. He'll likely thank you for it!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;7. Your documentation packet should have a cover page with the aircraft's name, your name, and the class that the model is being entered in. If your model is eligible for more than one class, attach a sticky note saying what class you're using it in today.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;Probably more than anyone ever wanted to know about how to detail a scale model...
<br />
