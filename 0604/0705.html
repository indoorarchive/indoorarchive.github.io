<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I just received Harlans rubber stripper and I can't quite figure 
</em><br />
it out...
<br />
<br />Rubber is sold in widths of 1/8, 3/16 and 1/4 inch. Any of these 
<br />
will work. I'd buy 1/8 or 1/4 if I were buying new. The supplier is 
<br />
FAI Model Supply. Either Tan Sport or Tan Super Sport is more than 
<br />
adequate when learning to fly indoor duration or scale models. Tru-
<br />
Weight rubber seems to be best suited to sport models.
<br />
<br />One pound of rubber is a *lot* for indoor - often a multi-year 
<br />
supply. For model classes where rubber weight is unlimited 
<br />
(Ministick, EZB, Int. Stick, etc.) it is often best to just strip 
<br />
rubber to a few likely widths and then tie motors to length at the 
<br />
flying site once you determine appropriate loop lengths thru 
<br />
testing. For classes like F1d and F1m it's best to pre-make (and 
<br />
weigh) motors at home. In other words, don't strip the entire one 
<br />
pound box all at one time.
<br />
<br />I'll walk you thru a visualization of the Harlan stripper:
<br />
<br />With the crank on the right and the cutters at the back you have two 
<br />
knobs, one on the left and one on the right. The two knobs control 
<br />
the two overlapping blocks or &quot;rubber guide&quot;. Rotate the knobs to 
<br />
open the width of the slot in the guide as well as to vary the 
<br />
position of the entire rubber guide left/right in relation to the 
<br />
cutters.
<br />
<br />The slot should fit the rubber strip width closely but still allow 
<br />
the strip to move forward and backward freely. The slot width 
<br />
adjustment is critical and typically the best way to set it is to 
<br />
reduce the size of the slot until the rubber can't be moved and then 
<br />
back off until it is just moveable.
<br />
<br />The width of the cut rubber is determined by turning both knobs to 
<br />
position the 1/8 or 1/4 inch(or whatever size)rubber strip in 
<br />
relation to the cutters. I usually adjust it so the strip that is 
<br />
being cut to the desired width is on the right or crank side of the 
<br />
rotary cutters and the remainder is on the left.
<br />
<br />With scissors, cut a few 4&quot; - 5&quot; long pieces of your rubber strip to 
<br />
use for setting up the Harlan stripper. Don't just feed in a piece 
<br />
of 1/8 or 1/4 and try to adjust the cut &quot;dynamically&quot;...it's harder 
<br />
to do and you end up with the remainder strip (the one on 
<br />
the &quot;left&quot;) of varying width. 
<br />
<br />It is almost impossible to then use the remainder because there is 
<br />
no way to determine which edge is variable. Variances in strip width 
<br />
cause uneven drag thru the rubber guide and the result is inaccurate 
<br />
cutting. Avoid this whole problem by setting up the stripper with 
<br />
short sample strips and then cutting 8-10' or more of rubber all to 
<br />
the same size.
<br />
<br />Push the sample strip into the slot until it meets the rotary 
<br />
cutters and turn the handle. You will feel it catch and draw the 
<br />
strip into the rotating cutters and through.
<br />
<br />You will need a tool to measure the width of the resulting cut. A 
<br />
dial thickness gauge is preferred by most flyers (Mitutoyo 7300 or 
<br />
similar. Check Ebay, much cheaper. Other brands are OK too such as 
<br />
Peacock, SPI, Teclock, Chinese knock-offs, etc.) The Ebay search 
<br />
keys &quot;dial thickness gage&quot; or &quot;dial thickness gauge&quot; will produce a 
<br />
listing of gages that are available.
<br />
<br />An alternative is a dial caliper. Not as user-friendly but will work 
<br />
fine. Insert the cut strip and measure. You want the pressure of the 
<br />
caliper jaws to be enough to generate a very slight &quot;tug&quot; but not 
<br />
significant compression of the rubber. Cut rubber edges are often 
<br />
slightly concave and the slight &quot;tug&quot; will compress just the edges 
<br />
enough to produce a true measurement of the strip width. Hold the 
<br />
sample strip in the caliper jaws up to a light to better visualize 
<br />
the measurement. 
<br />
<br />Adjust both dials on the Harlan stripper to reposition the &quot;rubber 
<br />
guide&quot; left-right as needed and cut another sample. The dials are 
<br />
calibrated in .001&quot;, but much depends on the pressure of the jaws,
<br />
and the strip thickness (which varies on Tan usually from .038-
<br />
.045&quot;).
<br />
<br />Always cut and tie rubber dry, never lubed. The lube will often 
<br />
cause the knot to slip. Many people, including me, wash the talc off 
<br />
the rubber and blot/air dry before cutting but that isn't a 
<br />
requirement. The main reason is to keep the cutter blades clean and 
<br />
sharp.
<br />
<br />On the Harlan stripper the trick is to learn to move both dials to 
<br />
move the 1/4&quot; strip left/right. That is where the paper calibration 
<br />
marks come in handy. By moving them both the same you can move 
<br />
the &quot;rubber guide&quot; in relation to the cutters without changing the 
<br />
drag on the rubber (by varying the opening size). 
<br />
<br />The Harlan stripper, because of its design, is vulnerable to nicks
<br />
on the blades so be careful not to bump them.
<br />
<br />Small or thin rubber will gain a static charge as it exits the 
<br />
cutters on the back side of the stripper and will cling to the 
<br />
rollers. It then tends to get pulled back into the cutters. Keep an 
<br />
eye on the out-spooling of the rubber and don't allow it to get 
<br />
pulled back in.
<br />
<br />Rubber in hobby stores from Peck Polymers seems to be Tan Sport from 
<br />
FAI, repackaged. Sig's rubber is probably also Tan Sport.
