<br />
From Bruce's long hocus pocus post I can see he is still drinking and has
<br />
not gotten the grasp of what has at all been said about the stiffness
<br />
testing and the adjustments I made on the program I use and distribute. Even
<br />
more interesting I have received an e-mail from one of the recipients of
<br />
Bruce's &quot;White Elephant&quot; TWIB sale and this particular proven world class
<br />
flier (yes Bruce there are people out there that through their
<br />
accomplishments have proven to have a more valuable opinion than you) said
<br />
&quot;Not sure at all what he didn't like about it.  It will appear in a F1D
<br />
soon.&quot;. So this is another case of REAL WORLD feedback not matching your
<br />
twisted ideas.
<br />
<br />Bottom line as pointed out by real live engineers that are on this list is
<br />
the stiffness factor is merely a helpful scale and as long as you compare
<br />
values generated from the scale it does not matter. As I have plainly
<br />
explained many times we individually test every sheet. We have taken the
<br />
range of values we see using the calculator I modified and broken it into
<br />
ranges of good, better, best. Then price the sheets using a formula that
<br />
factors in width, thickness, grain, and stiffness range. The difference in
<br />
price between 2 adjacent stiffness grades is $0.30 - $0.50. So the incentive
<br />
to discredit the product by is small. In addition Bruce's crazed balsa
<br />
busting has not at all addressed the fact that a sheet we mark as &quot;Good&quot; is
<br />
not as stiff as one we mark as &quot;Excellent&quot;. 
<br />
<br />Regarding Bruce's contention that the modification had nothing to do with
<br />
thickness, he is once again purely full of shit. I added to the formulas
<br />
math a piece of logic that says if the balsa is over a certain thickness
<br />
then multiply the stiffness coefficient number by a factor that increases
<br />
with the thickness of the wood. Very clearly the math is based on altering
<br />
the results based on thickness. As I have pointed out to anyone that cared
<br />
to ask this was to make the results more closely model the real world. I was
<br />
even conservative in this factor in that if I cut sheets from the same block
<br />
varying from .020&quot; up to .125&quot; grade them out to all be the same density and
<br />
then compare the resulting SC of the calculator, the thicker wood still goes
<br />
down in SC a little. So once again we have talking out his ass and telling
<br />
me that an adjustment I made based only on thickness has nothing to do with
<br />
thickness. More shit for a proven bull shitter.
<br />
<br />Bottom line is the vast majority of the indoor community understands what I
<br />
am offering and the value of the ratings. Fliers around the world keep
<br />
buying my wood and using it in planes that set records and win contests.
<br />
Bruce has for some reason decided that trying to discredit my product and
<br />
accuse me of being a crook is somehow a good thing. Guess when Bruce starts
<br />
offering a competing product we can all see if he has any clue. In the mean
<br />
time I will continue to offer my product exactly as I have in the past. If
<br />
you like what I offer buy it, if you don't then get it from someone else. In
<br />
the mean time if you want advice on building a plane from foam, Bruce sounds
<br />
like the man to talk to if you can catch him when he doesn't have his head
<br />
up his ass.
