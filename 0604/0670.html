Hey all, here is a quick report on the Kent contest glider stuff as 
<br />
I recall.
<br />
<br />In Standard Cat Kurt Krempetz came in and whooped up on the locals, 
<br />
taking first place a few seconds off the record pace thankfully.  He 
<br />
said he plans to return next year, so a fierce battle may up the 
<br />
record in 2007.  I was second, and Don Slusarczyk the budding 
<br />
gliderist was third.
<br />
<br />In HLG the new glider held together for the win and bettered the AMA 
<br />
record that stood since 1982.  The glider was a little heavy, and 
<br />
the boom was allot weak.  I had to hold back to prevent hitting the 
<br />
ceiling, and still had to repair the boom every third flight or so 
<br />
from launch damage.  Bill Gowen threw second, and Rob `Bode' Romash 
<br />
was third.  Rob also battled fuselage stiffness issues all day.  
<br />
Look for a much better performance when he returns in 2007.  
<br />
<br />Although Unlimited Cat was not on the schedule, Goins, Gowen and 
<br />
Krempetz were al flying it in search of the record, which was 
<br />
identical in time as the standard record set in the same building in 
<br />
2003.  Goins was very close to the record, until Kurt put up a 
<br />
couple of nice flights just over 60 seconds to grab the record.  
<br />
Hopefully Kurt will post some details here.
<br />
<br />So in the end only two of the three glider records were improved, 
<br />
but with many of the glider guys hooked on the great building 
<br />
promising to return, I am sure more will be set in years to come.
<br />
<br />On the rubber side the FAC turnout was notably down, with Miller and 
<br />
McGillivray absent.  The duration guys took up the slack though, as 
<br />
Jim Richmond was in the house.  Don Slusarczyk upped the Autogiro 
<br />
record with a 10 minute plus flight in a battle with Max Z.  I 
<br />
understand Max had a 13 minute flight unofficially that he was 
<br />
unable to repeat.
<br />
<br />That is about all I know.  There is a picture of the glider crew in 
<br />
the gliders folder.  Form left to right are:
<br />
Bill Gowen, Kurt Krempetz, Kurt Krempetz (with record setting UCLG), 
<br />
Rob Romash, Jim Buxton (wit record setting HLG), and Chris Goins.
<br />
<br />It was great to get out and fly again rather than BS.  I had a great 
<br />
time.
<br />
<br />~Jim
