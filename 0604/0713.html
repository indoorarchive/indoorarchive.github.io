Helped Bob Warmann run the state finals along with John Brayton.  The
<br />
site was the wonderful Category III site located in the University of
<br />
Illinois Armory in Champaign, IL.  I don't have the actual final results
<br />
yet but unless I'm mistaken the top three times were;
<br />
5:13 + for Jenna Brayton - Crystal Lake
<br />
5:05 + for Jason Holman - Prospect
<br />
4:52 + for Greg Hahn (sp?) - Rolling Meadows
<br />
All these times were plus 15 points for ribbon drop.
<br />
<br />Jenna's flight was particularly memorable as she was the second to last
<br />
flyer and put up her 1st flight in the high 4 minutes.  Watching her wind
<br />
puts me in mind of what I have read about the &quot;Old Masters&quot; winding
<br />
techniques - don't think I would have the patience.  She finally had her
<br />
2nd flight in the air and it really looked great if she didn't touch any
<br />
of the hanging obstructions.  The plane drifted from one side of the
<br />
field to the other and back and finally touched down at 5:13 +.   I
<br />
thought her dad John, who incidentally, was a nervous spectator
<br />
throughout the whole thing, was going to have a heart attack.  I remarked
<br />
to John that it was great to see that he made no attempts to influence or
<br />
coach Jenna, as some others tried.  His answer, in the inimitable &quot;father
<br />
speak&quot;, was something to the effect of &quot;Why bother, she doesn't listen to
<br />
me anyhow&quot;.  A real capper to a really nice day.   
<br />
<br />As an &quot;old goat&quot; I find it particularly refreshing and uplifting to see
<br />
all these S.O. kids giving it their best - makes me think that there may
<br />
be help for this planet after we're gone, in spite of us.
<br />
<br />If anyone is interested I think I will have a copy of the Wright Stuff
<br />
results in a day or so.
<br />
