There is already a F1D-beginner class. It used to be called 
<br />
F1D-beginner, but more recently it was re-named to F1M. The models can 
<br />
be built to be competitive without exotic materials, using only 
<br />
balsawood. Hobbyshop wood goes all through the construction, except that 
<br />
the body tubes are more easily made from special indoor wood. I have 
<br />
made models with fuselages sanded down from hobbyshop stuff, it is 
<br />
possible, but a bit tedious.
<br />
<br />Here in Finland we have multiple F1M's, and only a few F1D's, so the 
<br />
models share the airspace. Collisions are common, but an F1M-F1D 
<br />
collision poses no greater risk to the latter than does a F1D-F1D -one. 
<br />
That is, no damage usually takes place.
<br />
<br />F1M is easier to build, as the minimum weight is 3 grams, double that of 
<br />
a F1D. The model is almost as big as a F1D, so flying weight is not much 
<br />
larger. The construction is quite similar to a F1D, so tubes need to be 
<br />
rolled for fuselage. For the rest of the construction, balsa wood is 
<br />
sufficient. You guys in the US may be distracted with Bills carbon 
<br />
construction, but I may assure you that it is totally unnecessary. Wing 
<br />
spars cut out of 1mm balsa sheet, and 2.5 to 3 mm tall at the wing 
<br />
center section, are good and stiff for consistent flying. I have never 
<br />
used anything but balsa for my F1M wings.
<br />
<br />Another advantage of F1M is that the motor minimum weight is 1.5 grams. 
<br />
Thus the rubber quality and handling are not such super-critical as they 
<br />
are for F1D. Impressive flight times can be achieved with recent Super 
<br />
Sport rubber. But, the class allows the use of a VP prop, so you can 
<br />
also learn the secrets of building and adjusting such delicate 
<br />
instrument before moving on to F1D. The higher minimum weight allows the 
<br />
F1M VP mechanism to be built larger and heavier, and easier to handle 
<br />
(300+mg is perfectly OK) that those for F1D, so you can manage that more 
<br />
easier. No exotic materials needed for F1M VP mechanism either, even 
<br />
nylon M2 bolts are quite sufficient for the adjusting screws!
<br />
<br />For the rawest beginners, we have made a further restricted class, 
<br />
F1M-limited, for our local use in Finland (the rules made along similar 
<br />
class in Germany): restricted length of fuselage, so solid wood can be 
<br />
used, and ban of VP, so solid balsa prop is OK. That makes a nice path 
<br />
from SciOly type models towards F1D: first a F1M limited, then a larger 
<br />
F1M with fixed prop, then replace the prop with VP, and you are almost 
<br />
ready to move onto F1D. I have given courses on the three steps of F1M's 
<br />
here in Finland, and we have a couple of new guys on the climb towards 
<br />
the top tier...
<br />
<br />Later this summer I had a drawing of my F1M &quot;course model&quot; published in 
<br />
INAV. Let he heartily recommend that as a good and solid design for a 
<br />
beginner, as on a previous course we had 15 guys build them over a 
<br />
weekend, and almost all got their models flying on Sunday afternoon. 
<br />
Most flew straight off the building board, and several models made over 
<br />
10 minutes on their first outing. With a fixed pitch prop, in a 18 meter 
<br />
hall!
