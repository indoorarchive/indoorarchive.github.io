<br />
The organizers of the 2018 Indoor World Championships at West Baden estimate that at least 24 timekeepers will be needed for the event.  Each team has the option to provide one timekeeper.  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;The team-supplied timekeepers will be listed on the teams’ final entry forms.  These timekeepers, as per FAI Regulations, will be provided five nights’ lodging, Sunday night, March 18, 2018, through Thursday night, March 22, 2018, in a double occupancy room and meal expenses of $200 (debit card, etc.). The team-supplied timekeepers will also be provided lunch on Monday through Thursday and will be provided a ticket to the Thursday evening Banquet.  The team-supplied timekeepers will be expected to be present to work from 9:00 am until 6:00 pm from Monday, March 19, 2018, through Thursday, March 22, 2018.  Technical meetings of about 30-60 minutes for the team-supplied timekeepers on the evenings of Sunday, March 18, 2018, and Monday, March 19, 2018, are tentatively scheduled for 6:00 pm each evening.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;The organizer-supplied timekeepers will be chosen from applicants as explained below.  These timekeepers will be provided four nights lodging, Monday night, March 19, 2018, through Thursday night, March 22, 2018, in a double occupancy room and meal expenses of $150 (debit card, etc.). The organizer-supplied timekeepers will also be provided lunch on Tuesday through Thursday and will be provided a ticket to the Thursday evening Banquet.  The organizer-supplied timekeepers will be expected to be present to work from 9:00am until 6:00pm from Tuesday, March 20, 2018, through Thursday, March 22, 2018.  The organizer-supplied timekeepers must attend a technical meeting of about 30-60 minutes tentatively scheduled for 6:00pm on Monday, March 19, 2018, evening.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;All timekeepers must bring two stopwatches.  One digital, electronic stopwatch must be capable of timing to 1/100 of a second for 40 minutes.  The other stopwatch may be mechanical or digital and must be capable of timing 40 minutes to 1/10 of a second.  Stopwatch apps on smartphones, tablets, calculators, or computers are not acceptable.  A simple calibration check for all stopwatches will be performed at the timekeeper technical meetings.  If a stopwatch is used to time a record-setting flight, the stopwatch, if valid calibration papers are not available, will be checked and calibrated by the organizations at the end of the day’s flights.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Organizer-supplied timekeepers will be chosen by the organizers from the pool of applicants.  Applicants may apply by sending an email to the organizers at:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;leop at lyradev dot com
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;The organizers will start the selection process on or about December 15, 2017.  However, the selection process will extend through January 10, 2018, as the final number of needed timekeepers will not be known until that time.  Organizer-supplied timekeepers must hold a valid AMA license (or a current license from the FAI of other national aeroclub).  The organizers will notify all applicants of their status starting on or about December 31, 2017.  Applicants chosen as timekeepers will also be notified of the room details including the possible option to have a single occupancy room to share (with the organizers paying half the cost for the four or five days (about $90 per day).  Also, for those timekeepers who plan to compete in the Jim Richmond Open and who will be staying at the West Baden Hotel, the organizers will try to minimize any necessary room switching.
