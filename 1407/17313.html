I went and flew at Lakehurst yesterday since the hole in the wall is fixed
<br />
up. The air was decent but not spectacular as there was about a 11-13 mph
<br />
wind according to weather.com, with a max temp inside of 80 degrees and 39%
<br />
relative humidity . There was end to end drift during the day and later in
<br />
the evening side to side drift. I had to leave the end garage door open
<br />
because some workers were going in and out with vans all day.
<br />
<br />I flew 1.4 g F1D for the first time and despite my reservations, it was
<br />
still a lot of fun. I started by doing 1/2 motors off the carrier deck
<br />
without really looking how high the model was getting since Kagan told me
<br />
that I would never get to the top of Lakehurst. This couldn't have been
<br />
farther from the truth. I decided to launch my first full flight off the
<br />
carrier deck and it promptly got hung up in about 5 minutes and really
<br />
lodged itself into the girders. I completely destroyed the model getting it
<br />
down. After getting another model out and doing a few half motors, I flew
<br />
again, this time from the floor. In about 6 1/2 minutes, I hung the model
<br />
on the center catwalk. Great. After bumping the plane off safely, I rewound
<br />
the same motor thinking it would have a bit less climb; however, I hung the
<br />
model on one of the girders off to the side of the catwalk in about 8
<br />
minutes.
<br />
<br />Resolved to not hang up again, I opened the high pitch a touch and
<br />
relaunched. This time the plane got right up under the catwalk but did not
<br />
bump. A few minutes later the plane drifted off to the side and brushed the
<br />
side girder a few times, but I was able to steer the plane out. This flight
<br />
landed at 30:07. For the next flight I decided to open the high pitch a 1/4
<br />
turn, which kept me a safe 10-15 feet from danger. I had about 50 winds
<br />
less than the previous flight in this motor but still managed a backup time
<br />
of 29:53.
<br />
<br />I broke a lot of motors yesterday. It was hard to get the thinner motors up
<br />
to high enough torque to do any time. That was probably the biggest
<br />
challenge. So I don't believe the people who say we'll use less rubber
<br />
because we will be breaking more motors to get a flight off.
<br />
<br />Anyways, Lakehurst is back to it's former glory now that the wall is fixed.
<br />
Plan on making a trip and bring a friend. The hangar is sanctioned for a
<br />
record trials in two weeks (July 19-20) and for our annual end of the year
<br />
contest on Labor Day.
