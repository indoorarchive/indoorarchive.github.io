Jack Tian, the student I've been mentoring for the Wright Stuff event, had his regional Science Olympiad competition yesterday. I was unable to attend. I did get an email from him afterward. He had the best time, 1:17! The next best time was 51 seconds. Way to go, Jack! Unfortunately, Jack finished second... Seems he forgot his flight log, which cost him 30% of his time for scoring, giving him 53.9. The team with 51 seconds qualified for a 10% bonus, raising their score to 56.1, and putting them in first place and Jack in second. Jack felt he deserved the bonus, too, but didn't receive it. So, a tough break. After making far and away the longest flight, he didn't place first.
<br />

<br />
It's too bad Jack forgot his flight log. He'd have won easily. He had worked diligently to improve his airplane and flight times. I think he deserved to win. But, I told him he should be proud of his model flying that much longer than the next best. Forgetting his flight log was one of those painful learning experiences that will probably make him prepare more carefully for other events in his life.
<br />

<br />
Thanks to everyone for helping me help Jack do so well!
