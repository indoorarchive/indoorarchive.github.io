Congrats to Jack, and to you for your successful mentorship. On competition day, there is a LOT to remember, and for most kids WS is one of 3-5 tasks they will do during the day. He should be proud of what he did accomplish. Last year I had to sit on my hands at both State and Nationals when I saw my girls go to check in without their notebook. Both times they remembered and went back to their table to get it. 
<br />
<br />A few things I do that help: 
<br />
1. Get the rules in the kids' hands early, and quiz them regularly. At State last year, the judges started time as soon as the rubber was weighed. The girls quoted the rules and got it corrected. 
<br />
2. Run a few practices as if it were the competition. Kids set up all equipment, weigh in, answer questions, and are on the clock. 
<br />
3. Hold a strategy meeting before competition. Review the logs, decide as a team what the process will be (which plane, what rubber, what prop, what to look for and change for second flight) 
<br />
4. Make check lists. Keep them simple, but cover every step. I have one for check-in, one for table setup (listing everything to place on teh table, including glue and wax paper for repairs), one for winding and flights. 
<br />
<br />These are bright young kids, but the entire day is filled with pressure and expectations. WS is 15 minutes of their busy day. Hopefully these thoughts will help someone else perhaps lurking. 
<br />
<br />Again, good job on the mentoring, the constant improvements, and the successful flights. 
<br />
<br />Chuck

Subject: [Indoor_Construction] Thanks for the Science Olympiad help! 
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Jack Tian, the student I've been mentoring for the Wright Stuff event, had his regional Science Olympiad competition yesterday. I was unable to attend. I did get an email from him afterward. He had the best time, 1:17! The next best time was 51 seconds. Way to go, Jack! Unfortunately, Jack finished second... Seems he forgot his flight log, which cost him 30% of his time for scoring, giving him 53.9. The team with 51 seconds qualified for a 10% bonus, raising their score to 56.1, and putting them in first place and Jack in second. Jack felt he deserved the bonus, too, but didn't receive it. So, a tough break. After making far and away the longest flight, he didn't place first. 
<br />
<br />It's too bad Jack forgot his flight log. He'd have won easily. He had worked diligently to improve his airplane and flight times. I think he deserved to win. But, I told him he should be proud of his model flying that much longer than the next best. Forgetting his flight log was one of those painful learning experiences that will probably make him prepare more carefully for other events in his life. 
<br />
<br />Thanks to everyone for helping me help Jack do so well!
