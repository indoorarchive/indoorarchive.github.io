I'm afraid I'm the guilty party in the use of the &quot;weight factor&quot;. It's 
<br />
not a scientifically derived number. It comes from my use of the Hunt 
<br />
design program and the changes I've made to it for my own use.
<br />
<br />Basically I changed the program by removing references to the program's 
<br />
use of a 1.4x factor for rubber weight compared to model weight. I think 
<br />
when the program was developed it was for 65cm F1D's and a rubber weight 
<br />
of 1.4g was considered either optimum or maximum (I'm not sure which) 
<br />
for the 1 gram model weight. I didn't think this factor had any bearing 
<br />
on the models I fly so I removed it from the program.
<br />
<br />The result of that and some other fiddling I did was to remove the 
<br />
rubber weight from having any effect on the program's outcomes except 
<br />
for its effect on the all up weight of the model and the CG location. In 
<br />
other words adding rubber weight had the same effect on the performance 
<br />
numbers as adding ballast at the midpoint of the space between the 
<br />
hooks. The performance number that I was interested in was &quot;Sink speed 
<br />
as glider&quot;. The more rubber weight you use the worse the sink rate of 
<br />
the model becomes.
<br />
<br />Obviously if you have more rubber you also have more energy available so 
<br />
the degradation of the sink speed is not the whole story. When I test 
<br />
motors a heavier motor will almost always show a better &quot;score&quot; than a 
<br />
lighter motor. But as seen in the modified design program adding rubber 
<br />
weight makes the sink rate worse. Since I'm not smart enough to 
<br />
calculate how all these effects work together I took a simple route to 
<br />
get an idea of the total effect, I used the design program to calculate 
<br />
the sink rate based on the lightest motor I was likely to use and then 
<br />
did it again with the heaviest motor I was likely to use. Then I 
<br />
calculated the slope of the change in sink rate between these 2 
<br />
extremes. This slope is used to calculate the &quot;weight factor&quot; in my test 
<br />
routine. I calculated the &quot;weight factor&quot; for each different type of 
<br />
model that I fly.
<br />
<br />I think some of my test routines have been messed up by copying from one 
<br />
model type to another. The original weight factor for A6 was calculated 
<br />
with this formula:
<br />
<br />=0.69/(((0.13333*(D2-0.9))+0.69))
<br />
<br />where D2 is the motor weight, .69 is the sink rate in ft/sec with a .9 
<br />
gram motor and everything after that is the calculation for the sink 
<br />
rate with a motor that weighs more or less than .9 grams.
<br />
<br />So if you're testing a motor that's heavier than .9 grams you'll have a 
<br />
&quot;weight factor&quot; that is less than 1. Multiplying the weight factor by 
<br />
the motor score gives an approximate reduced score for that motor.
<br />
<br />If your test motor weighs less than .9 grams then you'll get a weight 
<br />
factor that is more than 1 and your corrected score will be higher than 
<br />
the raw score.
<br />
<br />A really good .9 gram motor may have a worse raw score than a normal 1.1 
<br />
gram motor but when the weight factor is applied the lighter motor may 
<br />
have a higher score and MAY produce higher flight times.
<br />
<br />I'm sure there are better/more accurate ways to figure out these effects 
<br />
but this is the way I'm able to look at the problem based on my very 
<br />
limited knowledge of the physics involved, and this method seems to 
<br />
produce usable results.
