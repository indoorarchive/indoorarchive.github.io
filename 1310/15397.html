As I've probably told you and others I'm not saying that my methods are 
<br />
correct or that someone else should adopt them. In this case what I've 
<br />
done is found an approximate result based on modifications I've made to 
<br />
someone else's hard work. There are a lot of ways to go wrong in that 
<br />
process but in general it makes sense to me. What I (and most everyone 
<br />
else) would really like to have is a program that would spit out 
<br />
everything you need to know to maximize a model and a motor for a given 
<br />
flying situation. We're not at that point and probably never will be.
<br />
<br />That being said there's not really any correlation between my motor 
<br />
testing routine and picking the proper motor length and weight. To get 
<br />
length and weight you have to input (into your brain's store of data) 
<br />
everything you've learned about flying. In the case of events without 
<br />
rubber weight restrictions you also have to decide what your flying 
<br />
style is going to be. In simple terms I fly longer and heavier motors 
<br />
than most people use so I consider that my style.
<br />
<br />When I'm preparing for a contest I usually will decide on motor length 
<br />
and weight and then make a variety of motors that generally meet those 
<br />
criteria. I will make motors from different sections of rubber and often 
<br />
from different batches as well (usually 3/02 and 5/99). What I HOPE to 
<br />
learn from testing this group of motors is which ones will give me the 
<br />
best chance of success. Since there are usually variations in the length 
<br />
and weight of individual motors and since heavier motors will usually 
<br />
score higher, I use the weight factor to normalize the scores.
<br />
<br />My version of the Hunt program still gives flight time estimates but 
<br />
because of the changes I've made I don't think they mean much. I use the 
<br />
&quot;sink speed as glider&quot;  and the &quot;static stability margin&quot; to determine 
<br />
whether changes are good or bad. And even those numbers give very 
<br />
suspect results in some cases.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bill (others are encouraged to jump in and comment, too),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for the through explanation. It will take me some time to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absorb all the subtleties of the changes you made to the Hunt program, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but you have given me food for thought. I do understand the basic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept &amp; reason for what you did.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When I began testing motors using your method I tested all the motors 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I had that were already tied up. As you mentioned, I quickly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realized that a heavier motor would almost always have a higher raw 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; score that a lighter motor. It occurred to me that if I divided the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; raw score by the loop length &amp; total weight of the motor the result 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be a dimensionless number (score) that might indicate the energy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; potential of each motor. I.E. the higher the &quot;score&quot; the more energy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; potential, regardless of motor weight &amp;/or length. I would still have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to decide which motor weight/length combination would be the best 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; choice for any given situation. Do you see any merit or flaw in this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach? Also, I assume your approach does not determine for you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which motor length &amp; weight will be optimum of any given situation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (ceiling height, etc.). Is that a correct assumption?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have used the Hunt program to test the theoretical performance of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different A6 designs, but I have always looked at &quot;Approx fixed pitch 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time corrected for low rubber ratio&quot; as my indicator of a good design. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A quick review of a few different designs seems to indicate a direct 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationship between &quot;Approx fixed pitch time corrected for low rubber 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ratio&quot;, sink speed &amp; Power needed for level flight. I wonder if there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is always a direct relationship between these. In other words is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; best time also always the best sink speed &amp; the best power for level 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flight? I did notice that there is not always a direct relationship 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between best time &amp; best L/D ratio.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Gary,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm afraid I'm the guilty party in the use of the &quot;weight factor&quot;. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's not a scientifically derived number. It comes from my use of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hunt design program and the changes I've made to it for my own use.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Basically I changed the program by removing references to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program's use of a 1.4x factor for rubber weight compared to model 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weight. I think when the program was developed it was for 65cm F1D's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and a rubber weight of 1.4g was considered either optimum or maximum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I'm not sure which) for the 1 gram model weight. I didn't think this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; factor had any bearing on the models I fly so I removed it from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The result of that and some other fiddling I did was to remove the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rubber weight from having any effect on the program's outcomes except 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for its effect on the all up weight of the model and the CG location. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In other words adding rubber weight had the same effect on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; performance numbers as adding ballast at the midpoint of the space 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between the hooks. The performance number that I was interested in was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Sink speed as glider&quot;. The more rubber weight you use the worse the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sink rate of the model becomes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obviously if you have more rubber you also have more energy available 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so the degradation of the sink speed is not the whole story. When I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; test motors a heavier motor will almost always show a better &quot;score&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than a lighter motor. But as seen in the modified design program 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adding rubber weight makes the sink rate worse. Since I'm not smart 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough to calculate how all these effects work together I took a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simple route to get an idea of the total effect, I used the design 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program to calculate the sink rate based on the lightest motor I was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likely to use and then did it again with the heaviest motor I was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likely to use. Then I calculated the slope of the change in sink rate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between these 2 extremes. This slope is used to calculate the &quot;weight 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; factor&quot; in my test routine. I calculated the &quot;weight factor&quot; for each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different type of model that I fly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think some of my test routines have been messed up by copying from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one model type to another. The original weight factor for A6 was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculated with this formula:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; =0.69/(((0.13333*(D2-0.9))+0.69))
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where D2 is the motor weight, .69 is the sink rate in ft/sec with a .9 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gram motor and everything after that is the calculation for the sink 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rate with a motor that weighs more or less than .9 grams.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So if you're testing a motor that's heavier than .9 grams you'll have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a &quot;weight factor&quot; that is less than 1. Multiplying the weight factor 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by the motor score gives an approximate reduced score for that motor.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If your test motor weighs less than .9 grams then you'll get a weight 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; factor that is more than 1 and your corrected score will be higher 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than the raw score.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A really good .9 gram motor may have a worse raw score than a normal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1.1 gram motor but when the weight factor is applied the lighter motor 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may have a higher score and MAY produce higher flight times.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm sure there are better/more accurate ways to figure out these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effects but this is the way I'm able to look at the problem based on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my very limited knowledge of the physics involved, and this method 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems to produce usable results.
