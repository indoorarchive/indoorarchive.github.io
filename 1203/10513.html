<br /><br /><br />Subject: DC Maxecuters Booth at the USA Science and Engineering Festival - April 28 and 29
<br />
<br /><br /><br />All,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />The DC Maxecuters in partnership with the Academy of Model Aeronatics, the Flying Aces Club, and the National Free Flight Society will have a booth featuring model aircraft at the upcoming Science and Engineering Festival.  The free Festival is on the 28 and 29th of April in the Convention Center in DC.  We are in booth 3351 of Hall A.  Come see us.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<br />The festival great fun in its first showing in Oct, 2010 and we decided that we couldn't miss this opportunity to talk to the public and share the fun and educational hobby.  It is expected that 100,000 people will come each day, with 14,000 students and teachers coming on a preview day on the 27th. Go to the attached website to find out more.  The goals of our participation are:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<br />1. Expose lots of school-age kids and their parents to the hobby.
<br />
2. Make contacts with people who once flew models and would again if they knew there was a local club.
<br />
3. Make contacts with  educators/scout leaders/engineering programs who are looking for safe,fun, intellectually challenging things for youth to do.
<br />
4. Connect to organizations that are trying to promote interest in Science and Enginnering education and perhaps open partnerships that provide access to indoor and outdoor facilities.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<br />After the Festival we are looking for places where we can demonstrate model flying - either indoor sites or outdoors.  That way if people want to know more they can join us at some local flying site.  If you know of suitable sites let me know.  For these purposes it can be as small as a gym or a soccer field.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Send me an email if you would like to know more about our participation.
<br />

I am asking for your assistance to bring people to the ultimate celebration of science and engineering, and it will take just three simple steps: 
<br />

<br />
Here is why I need your help:
<br />
<br />For the past year and a half I have been organizing the 2nd USA Science &amp; Engineering Festival - the country's largest celebration of science and engineering - a FUN, entertaining, educational and FREE event.
<br />
<br />So why have a Science Festival? Society gets what it celebrates! As a culture, we celebrate movie stars, rock stars and athletes and we generate a lot of them...but we don't celebrate science and engineering. If our country does not turn around the interest of young people in science, we will have outsourced innovation.
<br />
<br />The Festival has kicked off this week with our Nifty Fifty Program, and will continue with over 150 FREE events for the public and Greater Washington, DC schools leading up to the Finale Expo - all geared toward sparking an interest in Science and Engineering. 
<br />
You can find out all the details at: www.usasciencefestival.org
<br />
<br />The grand finale will be a two day EXPO at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington D.C. on April 28-29, 2012 - over 3,000 fun, hands-on, interactive activities and 150 stage shows for all ages. There will be stuff for the mildly curious to the science professional. You can learn about fun topics like the science of the magic of Harry Potter, the mathematics of jump roping, the physics of superheroes, the chemistry of Thanksgiving Dinner, the engineering of baseball bats and balls, the science behind special effects in movies, trends in Global Warming, renewable energy sources of the future.
<br />
<br />You can operate state-of-the-art robots, laugh with science comedians, be mesmerized by science magicians and mathemagicians, converse with astronauts, Nobel Laureates, storm chasers, science celebrities like Bill Nye the Science Guy, cast members of the MythBusters, Big Bang Theory and NCIS, and even scientists of the past, fly a fighter jet simulator, enter a virtual reality environment, be a CSI agent, learn how to transform your car so it can run off a cuisinart....and you can get info about scholarships, internships, mentorship and future jobs. 
<br />
<br />I would greatly appreciate if you would pass this email on to your contact list.
<br />
<br />Many, many thanks for your help. I hope to see you at the Finale Expo on April 28-29!
