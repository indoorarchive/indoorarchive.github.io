<br />
Hi. I am a high school student participating in the Helicopter event in
<br />
Science Olympiad. I have several questions that I would like to pose to
<br />
the group. I would really appreciate if anyone could respond to some of
<br />
my questions or thoughts. Even though most of my questions are general
<br />
and apply to pretty much all free flight models here is some background
<br />
on the helicopter: I am using a standard design: top free rotor, bottom
<br />
fixed, 3.5 grams min weight without rubber. Rubber is around 1.5g and
<br />
1/8&quot;. The basic design can be seen on this page
<br />
(<a href="http://freedomflightmodels.net/">http://freedomflightmodels.net/</a> &lt;<a href="http://freedomflightmodels.net/">http://freedomflightmodels.net/</a>&gt; ).
<br />
Both rotors are fixed pitch. Longest flight time wins.
<br />
<br />Rubber Motors--
<br />
1. Consider the following statement: When you use a rubber motor for a
<br />
flight, you need to let the motor rest before you use it again. If you
<br />
don't, you need to put in more winds to get an equal flight time.
<br />
However, after a couple of hours of rest the &quot;power&quot; or &quot;energy&quot; of the
<br />
motor will be close to the origional. How true is this? If this is true
<br />
what is the best way to trim? A lot of trimming is trying to change only
<br />
one variable and see the effects, mainly on flight time. If I am trying
<br />
to see how the position of the rotor on the motor stick affects the
<br />
flight I would like any parameters related to the rubber motor to be
<br />
constant. If a motor gets &quot;weaker&quot; each time I perform a flight, how do
<br />
I know if a change in flight time depends on the motor or the different
<br />
rotor position. Perhaps the motor gets &quot;weaker&quot; only if it is wound
<br />
close to the breaking point? Then the solution would be to trim with
<br />
fewer winds than what you would use during a competition? (I remember
<br />
reading that FAI model supply suggests that you use a new rubber motor
<br />
each flight, but that this was only applicable if you were winding close
<br />
to the breaking point.)
<br />
<br />2. What is the best way to prepare or break-in rubber motors? I lube
<br />
with armorall, but I have read advice on this group such as, &quot;wrap the
<br />
rubber motor around the hotel door the day before the competition&quot;
<br />
perhaps to prestretch the motor. Why is this done and what other
<br />
techniques in regards to rubber would be beneficial (and increase
<br />
times)?
<br />
<br />3. For the first time in Science Olympiad, there is no restriction on
<br />
the rubber motor mass. However, in regular free flight, this seems
<br />
commonplace. Does anyone have any advice in regards to this new
<br />
&quot;freedom&quot;?
<br />
<br />Rotors--My motors are fixed pitched so some of these questions are not
<br />
completely relevant but I am still interested.
<br />
<br />4. How do you measure pitch? What is the pitch/diameter ratio? In one of
<br />
the previous posts regarding the helical prop blocks I saw one of them
<br />
28&quot;. How is pitch measured by a unit of length?
<br />
<br />5. In my current design, the spars for the rotors are straight pieces of
<br />
balsa wood (see link). How great are the benefits of using a true
<br />
helical rotor design in which the spars are curved like most props in
<br />
advanced FF classes?
<br />
<br />Thanks for reading,
<br />
Chris
