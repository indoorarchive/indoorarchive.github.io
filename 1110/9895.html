Bob Brown was on the FAI Committee which was responsible for disallowing Curtis Wernette from being on the 2008 Junior Indoor Team, because he was &quot;not qualified&quot;. Five Juniors had flown for the team that year, but in 2008, four had dropped out, leaving only Tim Chang. Justin Young was talked into being on the team, rather than flying as defending World Champ. Then Brett Sanborn coached Curtis in building and flying F1Ds. He put up flights in the mid twenties at Lakehurst. But the FAI Committee said he hadn't flown in any qualifying contests, so wasn't eligible to be on the team. The AMA Executive Committee could have overridden this decision, but in their infinite wisdom, went along with the FAI Committee and wouldn't allow Curtis to be on the team. They couldn't grasp the concept that three people on a team is always better than two, regardless of ability. At the World Champs, Justin and Tim placed 1,2 and a third member would have needed only two 16+ flighte for the US to win the Team Champs!
<br />
<br />One person who has represented the US for many years at the CIAM meetings has commented that Bob Brown continually grouses about the FAI and thinks it has become stagnant. But, of course, there now are many more event flown than were in past decades.
<br />
<br />You know I didn't vote for him.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; He is my district VP, and I wrote him back when we were trying get the replacement 3rd Junior.  Not only didn't he support the idea, his cumulative response to a bunch of emails consisted of a single 1 line message.  In contrast, Dave Brown didn't support the idea either, but at least wrote back several detailed, thought-out replies.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My perception from that experience, and from reading his VP column, is that Bob Brown is ineffective.  I see a lot of claims in his &quot;vote for me&quot; paragraph, but I don't know of any recent noteworthy accomplishments.  Anyone know otherwise?
