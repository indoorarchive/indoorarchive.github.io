OK...you haven't seen my fingers either...I might as well use clubs to  
<br />
build with.  If I drop a pin I have to get a magnet.  The first real  EZB I 
<br />
built was the Hobby Shopper under Tim's pushing.  He gave me  everything I 
<br />
needed...the directions...and I built jigs, forms, tools and  everything.  I did 
<br />
all the right things with the bending gages, you name  it.  I made a feeble 
<br />
attempt to document it in the Max-Out.  To me  building an indoor ship was 
<br />
building a model that flew inside and not  outside.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The first time I flew it I thought I did rather  
<br />
well..considering....considering I probably doubled it's weight with glue from  fixing by the time it 
<br />
had made 10 flights.  Watching Kang fly in Colo  Springs made me a true 
<br />
believer that there are some people who can do this...I  believe I can again 
<br />
too..given another bunch of free time!  I did  figure out that after being an 
<br />
outdoor builder for 55 some odd years...indoor is  a special animal if you do 
<br />
it right.  You have to re-think things.   But it will improve your skills.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The steps to start with a P-24..then to a penny...then A6 and then EZB is  
<br />
logical.  I built the EZB first, then the penny and then the A6.  I'm  not 
<br />
sure that was logical, but I did learn a lot.  My next step is to not  try to 
<br />
prepare 2 weeks before a contest!  And, I have had some great folks  to 
<br />
watch and ask questions of...Don D, Bill Leppard, Kang, John Kagan, Bill  
<br />
Gowen...it's good to see what the state of the art can do.  Doing it?   I defer 
<br />
to the club fingers.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
It's magic......and  pretty magic it is!

<br />
Rick,
<br />
Didn't you process some of  Tim Goldstein's Tru-Weight balsa that he cut, 
<br />
6, 7 years ago? The rage was to  find balsa that would bend and snap back to 
<br />
original shape, and hold hammers  without bending. Once you have this 
<br />
outrageously strong wood with an MOE to  match, you can start building really 
<br />
light. (Yes, some indoorists will  disagree with this pre-requisite.)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I built an under 260mg  A-ROG, using reject cuts from under 500mg EZB 
<br />
building efforts. Building  light required a mind set, on my part, to do the 
<br />
task. The target weight was 300mg. Plus same for motor. It was  not to be braced.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
My weighing scale was  limited to 0.01g, so I weighed mulitple copies of 
<br />
each part and averaged.  Never new the total weight until it was finished. 
<br />
Even then, there was a  substantial +/-, due to humidity and scale accuracy. I 
<br />
tested parts for about  a dozen models, to get the stiffest and strongest 
<br />
(and lighest) parts.  Once covered with y2k2, I could not breathe  directly 
<br />
onto those parts; and many of the bones, prior to covering.  
<br />
<br />There were two &quot;go-by&quot;  models I used for material sizing guides. Both were 
<br />
braced models: Jim  Richmond's difficult to trim model, and Louka's, which 
<br />
I copeid. However, I  sized parts based on final support of 600mg. I stabbed 
<br />
built wing frames into  the weighing scale to make sure each half resisted 
<br />
0.3g with reasonable  deflection. One of the last things I did was crack the 
<br />
wing spars for a 3rd  set of polyhedral. It strengthened the spars and 
<br />
reduced fatigue  bending during flight. The motor tube collapsed at more than 
<br />
.1in-oz during  the first competitive attempt, so that was a limit. The 
<br />
highest time was 20+  minutes at Kibbie.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
It survived about a dozen  launches, until stress fractures crippled 
<br />
flights.
