Don,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Perhaps the wing would have not measured over the legal limit if not measured with 25 year old, cheap Walmart, cloth tape measure that had shrunk after being left out in the rain and dried in the oven. I welcome the new calipers so we can now at least read the numbers rather than needing to decipher faded foreign smudges.  Anyway, I am in good company losing a record flight at Kent by screwing up the weight or length limits.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;By the way, I did ask an assistant CD for permission to launch about 30 seconds after the official last launch time knowing that the F1L would land before the official contest F1D flight in the air at the same time.  We had thought it inconsistent and unfair that some classes had to actually finish (land) before others to be official contest flights. That is why I also had only one timer as needed during contests.  And, I wanted to take advantage of all the hot air on the flying area when everyone met toward the end of the competition.  The hot air probably added more than a minute to the flight time.  The time would have been even longer if one of your microfilm covered planes had burst into flames during the flight.  I also wish you could have timed the burst of flame to happen during my F1D flights at Urbana.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;All joking aside, both of the above actions were not smart on my part and I will again attempt to best the F1L Cat II record next April at Kent, where the officials, site and people (even you!) are all friendly, helpful, and great to be around for the day.  I look forward to giving your new tool a good workout.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;All the best,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Leo
