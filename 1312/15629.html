I would think the solution would be to select a longer motor so that it does not run out of turns, rather than a thinner motor. Of course, with no limit on the ceiling height you will eventually reach a limitation of some kind depending on the rules that apply to the classification of plane you are flying. For example, A6 limits the front bearing to rear hook to 6&quot; Max. Therefore, from a practical point of view there is eventually going to be a motor length that is too long to function properly.  
<br />
An event like EZB with no minimum weight presents an interesting dilemma. The airframe might have to be heavier (stronger) to carry a longer/thicker motor. Also, handling the higher launch torque would eventually create issues &amp; a VP prop is not legal.
<br />
But, a VP prop would not eliminate the torque issues.   
<br />
Interesting question.

Subject: [Indoor_Construction] To VP or not to VP?
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I've been wondering this recently - provided that you are flying in a 
<br />
tall enough hall, such that the ceiling is not the limit, would it be 
<br />
preferable to fly with or without a VP prop?
<br />
<br />My thinking has been going along these lines: the common knowledge is 
<br />
that one should fly with a motor that needs to be backed-off as much as 
<br />
there are turns remaining, and I interpret this so that the aim to to 
<br />
reach level flight (close to ceiling) at the &quot;turning point&quot; of the 
<br />
motor unwinding torque curve, i.e. the flattest part of the curve where 
<br />
it turns form convex to concave (or, in mathematical turns, the second 
<br />
derivative is zero). To me this seems to assume that the unwind curve is 
<br />
symmetrical, that the initial peak is as high as the end-of-the-curve. 
<br />
Which, obviously it is not, but the torque peak is much higher. 
<br />
Therefore, with a motor selected as  above, but no backoff, the initial 
<br />
climb would end up quite fast, and take the model so high, that towards 
<br />
the end of the flight it will run out of turns and deadstick. Or, if you 
<br />
fit the motor so that it does not deadstick, you end up with a rather 
<br />
thin motor, and climb quite rapidly to the peak altitude, and then 
<br />
cruise down for most of the flight.
<br />
<br />So my idea was to stick with the thicker motor, that provides the 
<br />
&quot;turning point&quot; of the flight later, but then, instead of wasting the 
<br />
initial torque to rapid climb, use higher pitch to slow down the initial 
<br />
climb, and gain more flight time but less altitude. Then, quite early 
<br />
onto the flight change into low pitch and spend most of the flight in 
<br />
that setting.
<br />
<br />In other words, my question is: is higher altitude always preferable (if 
<br />
there is no limit), or can a lower flight pattern be better?
