<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contest flights.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<br />Using that logic, then another person could have launched another model 
<br />
while your F1L was flying, and then another person and so on as long as 
<br />
one model is in the air then it is &quot;unfair&quot; to the next guy who wants to 
<br />
launch. Flights have to be in the air at the time of the end of the 
<br />
contest. If the end time is 4:15 if you launch at 4:15:01 it is no 
<br />
longer counted for the contest it is a record attempt. Rich Weber who 
<br />
told you it was OK to fly was not an assistant CD, and is not listed as 
<br />
such on the sanctions or contest flyer. He is a club organizer that 
<br />
collects money and gets people signed up at the contest etc. Only 
<br />
Michael Zand and I are the official CDs for the Kent contest. Rich was 
<br />
supposed to direct you to me for questions in regards to any AMA 
<br />
events.  I do not know why he said you could launch when in the past 
<br />
when people asked anything in regards to AMA events he always directed 
<br />
them to me. For some reason he did not do that with you. If he directed 
<br />
you to me I would have told you that you could launch but it will not 
<br />
count for the contest but you could fly for a record as record trials 
<br />
went to 10pm and you would need to have two timers. I have updated the 
<br />
Kent flyer to clarify these points plus will have some signs on the sign 
<br />
up table to make sure everyone is on the same page.
<br />
<br />The reason I am not flexible on extending the contest or allowing late 
<br />
launches is because a one day local contest is very much about time 
<br />
management as it is about flying. Like a football game, you have to get 
<br />
your scores in before the official time runs out. Many times at these 
<br />
contest the best models do not win and sometimes low flight times win as 
<br />
people run out of time so you have to plan your time wisely. Years ago 
<br />
we had a contest at a different site in the Cleveland area and people 
<br />
were complaining to the CD they needed more time to fly. So the CD 
<br />
extended the contest 15 minutes, then another 15 minutes. The result is 
<br />
there were 3 different &quot;winners&quot; for Limited Pennyplane. One winner at 
<br />
the official contest end, one at the first 15 min extension then one at 
<br />
the last 15 minute extension. So the last winner was happy but the first 
<br />
two were not. That is the risk you run by allowing extensions or late 
<br />
launches. Are you aware that your late launch meant I lost F1L? I had 
<br />
the high time at the 4:15 deadline. You launched late and then I lost. 
<br />
So it may have seemed unfair to you that a F1D was still flying but how 
<br />
was it fair to me that you were allowed to launch late? I was initially 
<br />
not going to accept it until Rich told me he gave you the OK plus I did 
<br />
not want to appear like I was not allowing your flight in the contest 
<br />
because it would knock me out of first place in F1L. Even if your model 
<br />
passed post processing it so happens it would not have stood as when I 
<br />
talked to Van Gorder about the situation he said he would not have 
<br />
accepted it with only one timer because it was launched late. He said 
<br />
since Rich Weber was not the CD of record, so asking him was the 
<br />
equivalent of asking the janitor for permission to fly, and he said it 
<br />
is also the responsibility of the contestant to know who the CD is.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is why I also had only one timer as needed during contests.  And, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wanted to take advantage of all the hot air on the flying area when 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everyone met toward the end of the competition.  The hot air probably 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; added more than a minute to the flight time.  The time would have been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even longer if one of your microfilm covered planes had burst into 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flames during the flight.  I also wish you could have timed the burst 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of flame to happen during my F1D flights at Urbana.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Any extra time from heat would be reduced by turbulence from your pacing 
<br />
watching the stopwatch :-)
