I see no strangers, only friends that have not met yet...
<br />
Hi. I am Phil Alvirez. First of all, I want to thank Mark for 
<br />
opening this website for the development of indoor modeling. After 
<br />
all, our only hope that this fantastic science of aeronautics could 
<br />
survive is by helping the newcomers with all the information they 
<br />
need, and by improving our knowledge by the exchange of ideas and 
<br />
information. I see model aviation, and indoor flying in particular, 
<br />
more as a science than a hobby. To me, it is also the dream of 
<br />
flying, of being myself that airplane on the air, to learn all I can 
<br />
about what makes it fly and fly better, and to help to keep the 
<br />
flame alive. I believe that the World needs dreamers, givers, not 
<br />
takers. People who is willing to give something to others. Lewis 
<br />
Carroll, the author of Alice in Wonderland, wrote: 'One of the 
<br />
deepest secrets in life, is that the only thing that is worth doing, 
<br />
is what you do for others.' So, thank you, Mark, for being the 
<br />
keeper of the flame.
<br />
I'm 71, and have been fascinated with things that fly, since I 
<br />
remember. I built my first plane when I was nine, and have been in 
<br />
and out since then, doing all kinds except indoor, that I did from 
<br />
1992 to 97. I have done Mini-Sticks, Limited Pennyplane and Open 
<br />
Pennyplane (monoplane). I entered competitions from 94 to 97 and I 
<br />
have been able to do well, thanks largely for the help from some of 
<br />
the greatest modelers. I am getting into 35cm, Intermediate Stick, 
<br />
and maybe F1d. I ran a hobby shop and organized a club where I gave 
<br />
free advice (there I learned what difference it makes when you 
<br />
provide all the means). Also, I have manufactured kits (Idealair 
<br />
Models-no longer). I like the intrincacies of designing and 
<br />
aerodynamics, and would like to find a partner to do some research, 
<br />
like finding a way to relate rubber to climate (I was doing that 
<br />
with Jim Clem). I consider competitions as an opportunity to try 
<br />
some ideas, and to meet new and old friends, and not a way to prove 
<br />
that I am better than some. That's why I enjoy so much competing.
<br />
I live in the suburbs of Windsor, Ontario, Canada, and this website 
<br />
is my son Luis'.
