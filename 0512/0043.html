<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Those of you who have secured a suitable local flying site within the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; last few years, please jump in and tell us how you did it.  Was it a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; windfall opportunity, or did you methodically &quot;find&quot; it and get it by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; skill and cunning? 
</em><br />
<br />I guess I'm one of the really lucky ones...  I get to fly pretty much
<br />
whenever I want in our church gym, which has a 20' clean tiled
<br />
ceiling, with the only obstructions being the typical light fixtures,
<br />
about 3'x3' square that only descend about 1', and they are spaced
<br />
about 15' apart...  all the other lights are recessed, so it is a
<br />
great site to fly in...  and the air handlers are just turned off in a
<br />
breaker box in the gym...  I can go in at night when no one is using
<br />
it (usually from 8-11) or on Saturdays if it isn't being used... 
<br />
doesn't cost anything for just me to use by myself, but I can get it
<br />
for $50-$100 a day for a Saturday if I wanted to invite others... (I'm
<br />
thinking of trying to get a Saturday in Feb for a Cat I sanctioned
<br />
event thru the AMA... if anyone would be interested in it...  probably
<br />
a long way for most to drive though...)
<br />
<br />I have also looked around, and as others have mentioned, private
<br />
schools are pretty good about using their facilities...  although it
<br />
does make it much easier if you know someone...  I fly occasionally in
<br />
another private school gym, but it is only about 25' with girders, so
<br />
it isn't as nice as my usual place...  I also talked to a local
<br />
community center, and could get their gym for the standard fee if I
<br />
wanted...  something like $50 an hour for the rental...  and the local
<br />
indoor soccer fieldhouse can be had for the bargin price of $150 an
<br />
hour...  which might be good for a contest, but out of the range for
<br />
just me...  although it looks like the ceiling is about 60' or so... 
<br />
could be good for a day contest if the rate could be negotiated...
<br />
<br />Also the local indoor RC guys have the use of an indoor hockey
<br />
stadium, which is a great site, in Hershey PA on Saturdays in the
<br />
winter...  only problem is that most of the time, their is ice on the
<br />
rink, which would make things both cold and interesting...  Haven't
<br />
been with them yet, but they invited me anytime I want to go...  I'm
<br />
going to try to get there after the holidays...
<br />
