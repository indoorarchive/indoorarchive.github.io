He guys,
<br />
I have been lurking here a while (I made myself a promise not to 
<br />
spend time posting here until I got caught up with some of my other 
<br />
duties such as getting a USIC CD and getting the National Cup points 
<br />
results completed), so anyway now I can finally say hello.
<br />
<br />I have been following the glider stuff, and Kurt I like your 
<br />
methods.  Using the car as a wind tunnel ala-Macready, good stuff!  
<br />
Do you have any video?  Also your advice of build a bit stiffer than 
<br />
you need, lighten till it blows up, then go back one step is spot 
<br />
on.  
<br />
<br />Anyway, as most of you know I am primarily a glider chucker like 
<br />
Kurt.  I also fly scale and duration, and have flown F1D, 
<br />
Intermediate Stick, EZB, LPP etc etc.  I got my competitive start at 
<br />
the 1987 USIC in Johnson City with a rather impressive class 
<br />
of &quot;rookies&quot; long before the Science Olympiad craze.  Don Slusarczyk, 
<br />
Don Deloach and I all competed as youngsters at USIC in Tennessee and 
<br />
the Lincoln Nats in Nebraska that same year.  
<br />
<br />I was introduced to indoor by a man named Ed Burke, Lord rest his 
<br />
soul.  If you ever met Ed you know that few finer individuals have 
<br />
ever come along.  Ed was the very first Pilot US-Air ever employed, 
<br />
and it was his retirement in the mid 80-s that brought him back to 
<br />
Indoor.
<br />
<br />I graduated from Pittsburgh Institute of Aeronautics in 1993 with an 
<br />
Airframe and Powerplant License from the FAA.  I went right back to 
<br />
school after that thanks to a slumping airline business and got a 
<br />
bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering.  I am now employed at 
<br />
Norse Dairy Systems in Columbus Ohio, where I design Ice Cream 
<br />
novelty manufacturing equipment.  Ice cream is a much sweeter' gig 
<br />
than the aerospace field for job stability.
<br />
<br />Lately I have been roped into doing more paperwork for model flying 
<br />
than building as the Indoor Committee chairman for the National Free 
<br />
Flight Society.  It is not at all my favorite part of the hobby, but 
<br />
something that gives me some satisfaction (and some frustration) 
<br />
trying to help the hobby that has helped me so much.
<br />
<br />Outside of work and modeling the biggest news is that I will be a 
<br />
father sometime in early February, as we are expecting our first 
<br />
baby.  This is without doubt exciting news for my wife Sharla and I.  
<br />
We do not know what we are having, but I am sure I will try to sneak 
<br />
in an 'off topic' post or picture about it.  I know Mark, I will do 
<br />
it on the 'Yahoos' list:) 
<br />
<br />I also enjoy working on old Fords.  I am currently trying 
<br />
(desperately before February!) to finish up a four-year front-end 
<br />
restoration on a 71 Boss 351 Mustang.  I have replaced everything 
<br />
(including half of the sheetmetal) in front of the firewall.  My 
<br />
father was a bodyman by trade and model builder for fun, so I have 
<br />
inherited his interests.  In talking with Jim Lewis recently we both 
<br />
realized that most glider guys seem to also enjoy refinishing wood or 
<br />
cars. It must be some sort of gene disorder that makes us want to run 
<br />
after stuff with a block of sandpaper in our hand in a magical never-
<br />
ending quest for perfection. 
<br />
<br />Oh well enough for now.  Keep the glider talk going, as I hear there 
<br />
is a Category II glider throwdown in Kent this spring.  Rumor has 
<br />
Deloach and Romash making the trip in from Colorado... 
<br />
