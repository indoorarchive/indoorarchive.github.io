Mark,  We are currently flying at the Forest View Community Center
<br />
(formerly High School) - last season we were flying under the auspices of
<br />
the continuation school there with the stipulation that we would teach a
<br />
class to their kids on flying model airplanes.  We taught them through 2
<br />
planes; the Delta Dart and the Starved Pussycat.  The kids had a good
<br />
time and generally did quite well and we old guys enjoyed it too.  This
<br />
year they aren't having the same school sessions so our head guy managed
<br />
to connect up with the adult education/community section and we have
<br />
promised to teach 2 sessions to their (hopefully) parent &amp; son/daughter
<br />
teams.  Hopefully that will work out well for us in upcoming seasons too.
<br />
<br />We currently, in a 135 minute flying session, alternate 20 minute flying
<br />
periods with the &quot;Dreaded R/C Guys&quot;, but manage to co-exist relatively
<br />
peacefully (I'm usually the rabble rouser).
<br />
<br />Just last week, with the help of a friend, I was able to get into a gym
<br />
in one of the local Chicago Park District field houses.  It is a
<br />
wonderful site in a relatively old but well maintained building.  When I
<br />
first got there I was immediately aware of the steady hum of blowers. 
<br />
The lady in charge tried everything she knew to shut them off but was
<br />
unable to find a way (they're not computer controlled like in the newer
<br />
structures.).  She promised to inquire of their electricians about the
<br />
possibility.  If they are able to control the fans it will be a nice
<br />
location with beam bottoms at about 25'.  In spite of the blowers I was
<br />
able to fly some of my smaller stuff in the more-or-less dead space below
<br />
the 4 blowers (at least I was able to get a couple of Fireflys trimmed
<br />
out and was able to demonstrate the Double Whammy for the director).
