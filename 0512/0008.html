<br />
Thanks to all of the advice from everyone on here, I finally had a
<br />
good night with my EZB...  I took the advice of the master, and went
<br />
to .040x9&quot; Tan SS (from this summer) and immediately did 13+ on a test
<br />
flight...  then I got out a loop of .038 3/02 that I had, made a 9&quot;
<br />
loop, and launched at .07 with 1500 turns and did 17:09, landing with
<br />
240 turns...  in the 20' ceiling gym that I fly in...  not perfect,
<br />
but much better than before...  I did a later flight at 16:33 with a
<br />
9.5&quot; loop of .044 Tan, launched at .1, and the plane handled the
<br />
torque well, but I think that the increased weight made the descent
<br />
too fast...  all were with the 12.5x25p prop from before...  Guess it
<br />
is time to make a few more props (questions below...) and get some
<br />
good stuff so that I can make more motors...
<br />
<br />Questions...
<br />
<br />- When everyone talks about &quot;flare&quot;, I'm assuming that it comes
<br />
primarily from the spar twisting to an increased pitch, not from the
<br />
blades...  and not talking about the frontward (from the side...)
<br />
flare of the prop spar forward...  Since I hit 20' in less than 1.5
<br />
min, I'm guessing that I don't have enough flare in the prop for that
<br />
site...
<br />
<br />- Is it best to flare the prop with the spar, i.e. more flexible, or
<br />
to move the spar back further on the blade...  I could move it back
<br />
another .15 or so to the very rear...
<br />
<br />- My prop weighs .153g, which seems a bit heavy...  I'm guessing by
<br />
the original MicroB article that I should shoot for .12g and that
<br />
should add some time...
<br />
<br />- I was at 74 rpm for the flight...  (1260/17) which seems to point to
<br />
more pitch to keep the rpm's down...  and I'm guessing that 3 min to
<br />
the ceiling is about right... 
<br />
<br />Does the above sound correct for the next round of prop/flight
<br />
conditions...?  I'm getting closer, I think...
<br />
<br />Thanks again for all of the help...
<br />
<br />JH
