<br />
Hi, guys. I guess most of you know me, but for the benefit of the 
<br />
others and to reveal some deep dark secrets of my past, I'll bend 
<br />
your ear for a bit. I'm an old retired engineer with 33 patents to my 
<br />
credit.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The best thing about indoor model flying is the really great people 
<br />
involved. Some of my best friends are indoor folks, but it seems the 
<br />
only time I get to see them is at contests where lots of time is 
<br />
spent visiting and renewing old friendships before much flying gets 
<br />
done. Groups like this one have made a world of difference in the 
<br />
availability of information, especially for those newbies who have no 
<br />
experienced mentors.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;My first recollection of being bitten by the &quot;bug&quot; was while flying 
<br />
a penny glider in my back yard and being amazed by it's ability to 
<br />
float through the air. Pretty easy to amaze a 4 year old kid, right? 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there were the dime kits. At one time there were 34 finished 
<br />
planes hanging in my room. A Quaker Flash gassie was built at age 10 
<br />
and flown the next year when uncle Harold Wickline showed up with a 
<br />
Dennymite on a Clipper firewall.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I organised a neighborhood model club that year and we had an 
<br />
indoor meet which I easily won even though I handicapped myself with 
<br />
a 6&quot; wing span. It was my first microfilm model.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The next year, a bus trip was made to visit uncle Harold in Dallas 
<br />
TX where it seemed the whole world was into model plane building and 
<br />
flying. I still remember Johnny Clemens hobby shop and his &quot;Hell's 
<br />
Fire&quot; Zipper. A Demon gassie was completed and I was in modeler's 
<br />
heaven flying with the week-end mob.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;By age 15 I had designed and built a class B gas job I named Upsi- 
<br />
Daisy. It managed to win twice against the aeronautical engineers of 
<br />
the Purdue Aeromodelers.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then U-Control arrived and speed and stunt were my passions for a 
<br />
while, culminating in my winning the prestigious jet speed event at 
<br />
the Plymouth Internationals in 1949.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A hitch in the Navy, college, and job changes interfered with model 
<br />
activity for a while, and I had given up on control line flying with 
<br />
the advent of Mono-line.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when we moved to Chicago in 1960 I took up indoor HL gliders 
<br />
and with my 1st son Randy we flew in the armories with the Chicago 
<br />
Aeronuts. Then came the Easy B's and because we wanted more stuff to 
<br />
fly,we got into paper stick and microfilm in 1964. In 1965 Randy won 
<br />
the jr national championship.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;My indoor progression was rather slow but Tenny's IN&amp;V and Bilgri's 
<br />
MAN articles helped to get me over the tough spots. I felt at a 
<br />
disadvantage relative to the experts of that time and knew I would 
<br />
have to be knowlegeable in working with the rubber if I was to do 
<br />
well. So stripper, scale, and torque meter were made and tests were 
<br />
conducted to find ways to evaluate and get the most out of the rubber 
<br />
motors.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I liked the idea of world competition so with the new 65 cm F1D 
<br />
rules of 1966 which everyone had to contend with I figured I might 
<br />
have a shot. Luckily the plane design I came up with turned out to be 
<br />
outstanding and I sailed right through to Rome, winning my 1st world 
<br />
champs in 1968 with a miraculous last flight. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And as they say, &quot;the rest is history&quot;!
<br />
<br />Jim Richmond, Carmel,IN
