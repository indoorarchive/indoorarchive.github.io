&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this is a moderator approved topic, I will give you our experience.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deal we have here in Ohio is a pretty good one. Many of you know 
<br />
or know of Dr. Vernon Hacker, his wife Nancy went to the Andrews Girls 
<br />
School and they have been donors to the school for many years. We have 
<br />
had access to the gym for about 10 years now. They actually have 2 gyms, 
<br />
one is 20ft smooth but very small, really only one model up at a time. 
<br />
The second gym is higher, 25 ft and much bigger but open girderwork. We 
<br />
now can fly anytime the gym is available, typically Sundays. Several of 
<br />
us have keys so we can get in and lock up when we leave. We have access 
<br />
to the lights and the blower system. There is a small group of us who 
<br />
donate money and we generally like to collect between $600 and $1000 per 
<br />
year and it is donated to the school for letting us use the gym.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think because this is a private school there is little (if any) 
<br />
public use of the facilities. My daughters elementary school has a 
<br />
flyable gym but because the school is public other non school groups are 
<br />
allowed public access to it. Such as ping pong, basketball, soccer 
<br />
practice, etc, all non school related. Now for us it is free to use, but 
<br />
it is hard to get scheduled in.  Fortunately  my wife is PTO president 
<br />
and is able to find out when the school gym is unoccupied, so I am going 
<br />
to try the air out one day. Sadly you only get about 1 to 2 hours per 
<br />
session, before the next groups is allowed access. So you only get a few 
<br />
flights in before you have to leave. I would suggest trying private 
<br />
schools instead of public. The Andrews school is really generous with 
<br />
us, and has never asked for any money, we just donate it and they are 
<br />
pleased with the situation. Perhaps you can find something similar.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was younger the janitor at my Junior High School was a nice 
<br />
guy (Wally), my dad and I stopped one day and talked to him , showed him 
<br />
a model, and he let us fly whenever we wanted. We could fly from like 6 
<br />
to 9 pm and he would clean the gym last so we could fly as long as 
<br />
possible, sometimes to 10 pm. Throw in a 6 pack of beer once in a while 
<br />
and he was real happy, we did that for 2 years before he left the 
<br />
school.  Also dont bring up rental cost until they do. You have to show 
<br />
them a model first, if you call and say I want to fly a model in your 
<br />
gym, then they think either big gas RC or control line (true life 
<br />
experience) Once they see what you have it makes life much easier. If 
<br />
they want money tell them are only a few of you. I talked down the 
<br />
rental at our one indoor contest from $250/hour to $800 for the whole 
<br />
day. So it can be done. Just takes patience. Look at what Van Gorder did 
<br />
for West Baden, took him 18 years of dinners and meeting to get those 
<br />
few contests.
<br />
