## Yahoo ML Indoor Construction Archive

### Browsing version

The browsing version is available on https://IndoorArchive.github.io

### Why this archive ?

In October 2018, Yahoo informed their ML service is shutting down, and all posts from Yahoo Groups will be deleted.

```
Beginning October 28, new content won't be able to be uploaded to the site,
and all previously posted content on the site will be permanently removed after December 14.
```

### Where the archive comes from ?

An .mbox email achive of the messages have been saved before the service shut down (Thank's Mark).

Then https://github.com/hypermail-project/hypermail has been used to convert this mbox achive to HTML files.

After exploring several possibilities for web hosting of those HTML pages, it has finally decided to store them (at least) on GitHub.


### What is this all about ?

### Is there a new Yahoo ML replacement ?

Yes, there is, until that new one decide to shutdown or to make it expensive.
