## Yahoo ML Indoor Construction Archive

### Browsing version

The browsing version is available on https://IndoorArchive.github.io

### Why this archive ?

Yahoo Groups decided to shutdown it's MailingList service and delete everything:

```
Yahoo is shutting down its Groups website and deleting all content
Your ancient posts will disappear on December 14th 2019.

Yahoo is phasing out one its longest-standing features. The internet pioneer is closing the Yahoo Groups website in a two-phase process that will effectively see it disappear. You'll lose the ability to post new content on October 28th, and Yahoo will delete all "previously posted" material on December 14th. 

Still, this could be a sad moment for some. Much like the GeoCities shutdown, Yahoo is erasing a piece of internet history. Even if you haven't used Yahoo Groups in years, you might still have a presence there -- say, a fan club for a favorite band from your youth. Yahoo is effectively erasing that historical record, even if it's likely to live on through archive services.

### Where the archive comes from ?

An .mbox email achive of the messages have been saved before the service shut down (Thank's Mark).

Then https://github.com/hypermail-project/hypermail has been used to convert this mbox achive to HTML files.

After exploring several possibilities for web hosting of those HTML pages, it has finally decided to store them (at least) on GitHub.


### What is this all about ?

### Is there a new Yahoo ML replacement ?

Yes, there is, until that new one decide to shutdown or to make it expensive.
