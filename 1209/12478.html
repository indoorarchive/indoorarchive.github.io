<br />&lt;&lt;Why don't we stay on topic ?&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Posted before above, &quot;By all means discuss and tweak away.  I merely hope that big changes could be proven locally and regionally  to help avoid unintended/undesirable consequences.&quot;  
<br />
<br />And before any tweaks are legislated, yes, stakeholders should discuss it--thought that was a given.        
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Maybe not regarding bracing ezbs with wire, but I was trying to riff about what your title suggests to me, &quot;Beginner Events and why they're hard for beginners.&quot;  
<br />
Those wanting model spec changes on behalf of beginners should try to nail, &quot;What are really the needs of beginners?&quot; I hope we begin with the assumption that beginners do not really want to stay &quot;beginner&quot; for very long.  If agreed, then is it not the community's role to make sure there are adequate learning-step events to fly, as well as a couple outright &quot;beginner events&quot;?  Does lowering the difficulty of ezb, F1L, help meet target needs of newcomers?  It's happened before with ezb--example, did  banning microfilm have the desired result?  Prescribing paper cover? (I don't know, asking rhetorically.)  
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;I have zero position on this notion.&gt;&gt;
<br />
I'm likewise ambivalent about tweaking rules to allow wire bracing, other than to consider the history of any such applicable changes.  And if someone wants to resurrect LC's AMA proposal for .60g minimum ezb, it would be my excuse to build some new ones. I think either a .6g proposal, or a bracing proposal would target average contest flyers, rather than &quot;beginners&quot; per the title.   
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are about 10 people who fly indoor in San Diego semi-regularly.  9 of them are beginners.  I think this is probably true at many local clubs.&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<br />9 beginners interested in duration? I'm jealous! Wouldn't that be a ideal test bed to see if ezb bracing reduces their frustration level?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If we could snag a few per year and help them build anything,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we may not need to discuss AMA event tweaking twice a year.&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&lt;&lt;Why can't we do both?&gt;&gt; 
<br />
<br />Surely, both appropriate, especially considering that &quot;If&quot; isn't happening for most flyers, even if we want it to.   Also suggesting that given moderate success with #1 (growing new indoor flyers) the present AMA events slate may suddenly seem quite adequate. I'm going to continue to advertise our local meets in Craigslist, offering trimmed models, personal tutoring, etc. Thousands more people need to at least see live indoor, and know what's accessible.    
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bill Gowen and I would like to discuss the merits of adding motor stick bracing to events such as F1L, A6, EZB, Ministick.&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Maybe also allow the adding of any amount of wood to motorstick to beef up an errant motorstick?  That way one could start out as lightly as one dares, but with another parachute available. Again, would hope to discover unintended consequences first. For example, someone discovers a very good lamination process, and then everyone thinks they have to do the same to be competitive.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bill Gowen and I would like to discuss the merits of adding&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<br />But not possible demerits?
