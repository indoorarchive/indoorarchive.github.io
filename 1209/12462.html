&nbsp;Not looking to start a fight  . But 
<br />
<br />- who or what defines a beginner?
<br />
-Who or what defines an expert?
<br />
-How long does one remain a beginner? / expert?
<br />
- How Is  ones status  determined ?  at each contest or is it variable ? ie: can an expert  declare himself a beginner at one contest and subject to beginner rules,and enter as an expert  at another contest  and  follow those rules and not enter any beginner events.? 
<br />
&nbsp;I was a CD for the USIC and other contests thru the years and found out that everything must be spelled out.even though it makes perfect sense to you. The guy reading the contest flyer may interpret a rule differently ,because he doesn't know the &quot;intent&quot; of the rule or it's purpose.   Just some food for thought.
<br />
<br />Today's World Champs were once beginners I was fortunate enough  to see some of them rise thru the ranks starting with Science Olympiad rubber powered  up to F1D..Maybe I'm   a dreamer but I believe there will always be those who are  drawn toward Indoor duration and the hypnotic beauty of a model cruising by at 3MPH.If not there's a ton of other type models   
<br />
&nbsp;to chose from. Nuff said

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't worry Bill, I don't think anyone will listen to me. I've been saying this for years...

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IMHO The way to make Beginner events successful is to prohibit Experts from flying them. Simple rule, if you fly the beginner event you don't fly any others.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may be stepping on Kang's toes a little here but he and I had almost the exact same thought about a way to make beginner events easier. Since I thought of it yesterday I'm adopting it as my idea.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rules for LPP, F1L, EZB and A6 say the MS has to be solid wood and in different ways and to different extents pretty much rule out any sort of bracing. Making a MS work correctly and not weigh too much is one of the hardest parts of building any of these models. It's a part of building that requires the most care in wood selection and building experience. It's probably one of the main reasons why experienced flyers have such an edge in these events.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this may be blasphemy but why not pick one or two of these events and say that the MS still has to be solid wood but you can brace it. The bracing could be limited to thread or wood or you could just leave it open for people to experiment with.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who have successfully conquered the MS problem wouldn't have to change anything and would probably still win but the beginning flyers would have a much better chance of building a flyable model to the minimum weight.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've seen a few beginning indoor flyers who have spent a lot of time building a model but just get really demoralized when they couldn't make it fly. Having this type of experience is not good for keeping people interested.
<br />
