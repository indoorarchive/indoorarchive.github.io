Bill (Carney),
<br />
<br />First, LPP, F1L, and A6 are already successful events.  What Bill Gowen and I are suggesting is a way to make these model events easier to build and fly.  It is actually a way to lower the barrier of entry.
<br />
<br />This proposal cannot bridge the gap between experts and beginners.  That gap is narrowed only through experience, experimentation, and skill.  This proposal, however, can make some of these classes even more accessible, which I hope means more enjoyment.
<br />
<br />I had a really hard time making my EZB fly last weekend because of excessive bowing of the motor stick.  I understand why beginners and intermediates do not want to fly a 0.5 g EZB.  But if MS bracing is allowed, the 0.5g EZB becomes a much tamer pet.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IMHO The way to make Beginner events successful is to prohibit Experts from flying them. Simpl e rule, if you fly the beginner event you don't fly any others.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I may be stepping on Kang's toes a little here but he and I had almost the exact same thought about a way to make beginner events easier. Since I thought of it yesterday I'm adopting it as my idea. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The rules for LPP, F1L, EZB and A6 say the MS has to be solid wood and in different ways and to different extents pretty much rule out any sort of bracing. Making a MS work correctly and not weigh too much is one of the hardest parts of building any of these models. It's a part of building that requires the most care in wood selection and building experience. It's probably one of the main reasons why experienced flyers have such an edge in these events. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So this may be blasphemy but why not pick one or two of these events and say that the MS still has to be solid wood but you can brace it. The bracing could be limited to thread or wood or you could just leave it open for people to experiment with. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The people who have successfully conquered the MS problem wouldn't have to change anything and would probably still win but the beginning flyers would have a much better chance of building a flyable model to the minimum weight. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've seen a few beginning indoor flyers who have spent a lot of time building a model but just get really demoralized when they couldn't make it fly. Having this type of experience is not good for keeping people interested.
