<br />
To all,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I guess it's time to put my thoughts here now.  The discourse of  
<br />
beginners, etc will always be there.  What one has to face is there really  is a 
<br />
group of dedicated flyers that are REALLY dedicated to Indoor.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
But, there are a lot of fringe flyers...myself included, that fly indoor  
<br />
for the fun and the awe that it provides. Knowing this, I still go to the  
<br />
events where I can and talk to the Kang Lee's and Bill Gowen's and pick  their 
<br />
brains.  To be honest...I don't build an indoor model but ever six or  9 
<br />
months.  I fly outdoor FF during the summer and indoor in the  winter.  Indoor 
<br />
is not my primary focus, but I really think it's  great.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I have some better than average skills so I'm not intimidated by  
<br />
indoor...it's just that I ask myself the question of how much time do I want to  
<br />
spend on trying to get a quarter gram EZB?  If you are &quot;new&quot; to  this and do not 
<br />
have any building skills...it is daunting.  I have yet to  come across 
<br />
someone who is telling me &quot;Gee! this is great!  How can I spend  most of my free 
<br />
time doing this?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The question always seems to revolve around EZB...is it  mis-named?  Of 
<br />
course it is.  A6 is the replacement of EZB because of  that.  When ever there 
<br />
is a flying event, there is always some open  ended rule or one that is 
<br />
missing.  I struggle with this all the  time.   Outdoor FF has some rules that 
<br />
have gone amuck....&quot;AMA Classic  Gas&quot; is one.  It is way beyond the intent or 
<br />
flavor of the intended  event.  What is the &quot;flavor&quot; of the event and the 
<br />
rules that govern  it?  why did the rules not satisfy the intent?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
In a perfect world, EZB should have had rules that govern stick size or min 
<br />
&nbsp;weight.  F1L does and that is probably why it is the popular event it  
<br />
is...it is achievable by the average modeler.  Yup, Kang's achievement  is 
<br />
incredible, but not to be considered &quot;Easy.&quot;  I, again, am in awe of  it.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Back to the issue....beginners thrive in their ability to learn  and 
<br />
compete in events that are achievable...forget EZB without some massive  rules 
<br />
change.  It's an 18&quot; open unlimited event.  Perhaps there should  be &quot;novice&quot; 
<br />
EZB with 1/16&quot; sticks for LE's and TE's ala A6 with some minimum  weight, but 
<br />
I would think renaming the current event and it's rules would be  better.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
When I go to events and the spectators see what the bar is...they just shy  
<br />
away.  We here in Colorado don't try to impress them with a half gram  
<br />
model...we want to get them flying ASAP and the way we do it is hand them a  
<br />
model that they think they could build and fly in competition and be successful 
<br />
&nbsp;at.  That's where you start.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Having a few P-24's laying around doesn't hurt.  Then if one gets  excited 
<br />
about indoor flying...there is a goal...but you have to get the spark  lit.  
<br />
For the many interested folks out there...there is a huge leap from  
<br />
attending and competing...and a bigger one from flying a P-24 to building a half  
<br />
gram EZB...it's more than a spark...it's an igniter that's needed.

<br />Bill,  and others,
<br />
<br />I talk and work with a lot of beginners at our club's  flying sessions, and 
<br />
I understand a lot of the issues that a beginner  faces.  My experience as 
<br />
a beginner is different from most of the fliers  that I meet, but I can see 
<br />
clearly what's going on with them.  In time, I  can discuss the beginner 
<br />
difficulties that I see.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The first thing I discovered when I  started flying F1D is that a F1D is 
</em><br />
a lot easier to launch than the &quot;beginner&quot;  models I fly. I have spent a lot 
<br />
of time on EZB, F1L, and Limited Pennyplane  (LPP). Raise your hand if you 
<br />
have had your EZB or F1L dive on launch because  the motor stick was too 
<br />
flexible? (Both mine are raised.) 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In an  ironic way, we have made our beginner models harder to fly than 
</em><br />
F1D. Of  course, we know one reason -- a solid wood motor stick is easy to 
<br />
build but it  generally does not work well under high torque and tension of the 
<br />
rubber  motor. 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bracing a solid motor stick is relatively easy to do, whether  using wood 
</em><br />
bracing or thread. Bracing substantially increases the performance  of the 
<br />
motor stick. Not only will this help to make these beginner models  launch 
<br />
better, allowing bracing means the quality of the solid motor stick  does not 
<br />
have to be as good. Hobby shop balsa can be used. A lighter MS can be  
<br />
used, and the weight budget can be used elsewhere. These all greatly lower the  
<br />
barrier of entry for the beginner -- YET, these effects increases the  
<br />
performance of the model for the beginner. You don't usually find these  
<br />
&quot;win-win&quot; scenarios.
