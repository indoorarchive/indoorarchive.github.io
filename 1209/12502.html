Jeff,
<br />
<br />I appreciate that you shared your thoughts.  I realize that a lot of EZB fliers (and fliers of other classes) have worked very hard to overcome the many obstacles.  I truly appreciate that hard work and do not mean to slight anyone.
<br />
<br />I have paid my dues as well, but my view is slightly different than yours.  I feel that some of the obstacles are unnecessary and do not positively promote our sport.  Sometimes a big obstacle turn people away.  I do not feel that bracing an EZB would dumb it down.  Flying an EZB well will still have more than enough challenges.
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
<br />-Kang

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I generally try to abstain from posting on threads like these, but I'm going to throw in my 2 cents now...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I started building indoor in May 2005, and first flew at Lakehurst on July 4th 2005...  And I *definitely* did not consider myself an &quot;expert&quot; then or even now...  In Dec 2005 in EZB, I did 18+ in a 20' site...  and between 2006 and 2010, took home places at USIC (mostly EZB...  never won, but did okay...)  And in Sept 2009 (I think...) I got to my goal of breaking 30 min in EZB (barely, but hey it counts...)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kang makes my progress look totally lame by comparison...  In just a few years, not only did he break 30 min in EZB, but blew the record apart recently...  and in *much* less time...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why point this out...?  Well, it's because doing well in indoor isn't about the &quot;difficult&quot; rules...  I'm sure Kang did the same as I did with motorsticks...  tested hundreds of sticks, practiced often (gee, what a concept to think that would help improve...) and basically worked at it to get somewhere...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Point is, like **anything** else in this world, success comes with hard work...  Business, hobbies, whatever...  And making things easier isn't the answer...  never has been, and never will be...  I'm entertained by the notion that Limited PP has to be changed...  That means that the version of the rules that way back were written to make it &quot;easier for beginners and keep out the experts&quot; didn't work...  Gee, who would have thought...?  Isn't the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results...?  So then why does this illogical topic keep on coming up over and over again...?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I had the privilege of being the team manger this year for the F1D WC...  and with that, got to see -every- flight from beginning to end of all the US team members flights...  and watched the preparation before the flights of all of them...  (and also many of the other winners flights and prep as well, when I could be watching...)  And I learned more during those hours about F1D and what it took to compete than I would have thought I would...  I never posted when the inane discussions about chance were taking place, since most of the time when I was reading them I was laughing too hard to type, but I can say *for sure* that the fliers that are the most consistent and at the top aren't there because of air, thermals, rubber, chance, or anything that vaguely relates to that...  They are successful because of what makes anyone successful at anything...  Hard work, persistence, and determination (along with other similar things...) get you to the top...  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I got a 30+ flight in EZB in just over 4 years because I worked my ass off trying to get there...  and I know Kang worked his off too...  Point is, we don't need to dumb things down...  Hasn't worked before, and won't ever work...  The psychology of what makes an indoor flier is a whole other topic, but I've been around enough to know that making more &quot;beginner&quot; rules isn't going to help anything...  But then again, our society has been teaching everyone that &quot;everyone should be a successful&quot; for far too long...  thing is, it doesn't really work that way...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway, rant over...
