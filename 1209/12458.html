<br />The expert may not have to rebuild at first, but will of course
<br />
eventually decide to go even lighter using bracing. Then it's back to
<br />
the status quo of newcomers trying to match the weights of what the more
<br />
experienced can do, but can't match the strength.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;and would probably still win but the beginning flyers would have a
<br />
much better chance of building a flyable model to the minimum weight.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Sure, in the case of ezbs they are &quot;asking for i,t&quot; that is, if a
<br />
heavyish but flyable model is not acceptable to them, due to
<br />
perceptions.  But are there many LPPs not flyable?  Many A6s not
<br />
flyable?  Newcomers want to have the perception that their models are
<br />
potentially competitive, even if their skills are lacking. To be merely
<br />
flyable is usually not good enough, almost right after one's first
<br />
flyable duration  model.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">  &gt;&gt; I've seen a few beginning indoor flyers who have spent a lot of time
</em><br />
building a model but just get really demoralized when they couldn't make
<br />
it fly.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Being the one apparent &quot;beginner&quot; among many experienced flyers at a
<br />
contest may be  more demoralizing.  But if tweaking an event or two will
<br />
solve this, then who would object--simply show its success on local
<br />
level, and that should ascend to national level tweak.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;Having this type of experience is not good for keeping people
<br />
interested.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Depends on what interests people in the first place.  Is it to have a
<br />
flyable model? A &quot;fun&quot; model?  Or a competitive model with skills to
<br />
match?  Surely, if the perception is that a .24g ezb will become de
<br />
rigeur, that may turn off participants for the event, but not
<br />
necessarily bad for a newcomer who should try LPP anyhow.  JMO.
