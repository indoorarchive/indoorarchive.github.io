Ron, 
<br />
<br />I'm just curious about your &quot;set the hook before I decided to sell everything off&quot; statement. Does this mean that you are no longer planning to fly indoor? or That because of Kibbie you have decided to keep your stuff and continue to build and fly? 
<br />

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I'll put my 2 cents in since I'm a &quot;raw&quot; beginner. My problem is getting the best materials, wood, there is a good source but for how long? Secondly is the rubber for the motors. Some fliers have many pounds of the &quot;good stuff&quot;. I paid a small fortune for some &quot;vintage rubber&quot; years ago. Then you have the basic tools, winders and rubber slitters . I was fortunate to be able to purchase a Geauga winder and rubber slitter which at the time the two totaled about seven hundred dollars. I had the money then! Also you need a balance that weighs milligrams, that cost me about three hundred dollars, a balsa stripper of some sort, and the simple torque meter, do you see the pattern? 
<br />
<br />A raw beginner can probably get by with less in some areas, but indoor flying really is a technical sport. Clubs could probably pool their assets to reduce individual expenses. I have intended to fly indoor duration for about seven years now. Originally work commitments, then health issues have kept me from doing anything but observe through whatever &quot;portal&quot; that was available with indoor duration information. 
<br />
<br />My Kibbe Dome Experience this year set the hook before I decided to sell everything off. The experience of observing and timing flights was a fantastic experience. I was able to fly a LPP twice before I put it back in the box. The first time was about 7 minutes, with a little help from Larry Coslick , he changed the pitch of the prop with his fingers from about 24 inch pitch to about a 23 inch pitch. The second flight went over 10 minutes. I was satisfied that I could get a model airplane to fly on a rubber motor for more than 30 seconds. I did not post any times. 
<br />
<br />After that flight, I just sat back and watched Larry do his thing! I feel that the Pro-Am category should be included at all indoor contests if possible, there is nothing like having an instructor 
<br />
one-on-one to correct and recommend, something I once did in my past life! 
<br />
