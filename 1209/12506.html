As a beginner, I think that both these suggestions are terrific ideas.

<br />
<br />Here is the comment I mistakenly made using another subject and had no response....   
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />When I was shooting in pistol competition there were three classes.  Everyone started in C or Novice class.  If you finished in first or second for a total of three times you moved up to B or intermediate class.  When you finished there in first or second for a total of three times you moved up to A or Open class.  
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Could something similar be done in Indoor flying?  The advantage the flyers have over the shooters is the use of timers.  In the shooting the matches were win or lose double elimination matches.   In indoor there could be a three win limit or you could have time classifications.   I was thinking it could be different times for different classes.  Once you win or place in A-6 with 5 minutes or more you move up and then when you do the same at say 7 minutes you would move up to top class. EZB could be 15 and 20 and so forth.  I know it would be a scorekeeper's headache, but I remember how proud I was when I shot my way out novice.  I think the same would be the true when someone flew out of novice.  
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Just thinking out loud....

<br />This discussion has been about the planes and coming up with a set of rules that will enable beginners. Perhaps it would be better to consider developing the skills required. In other modeling competition like RC Pattern the beginners are separated from the advanced flyers by having classes that are based on skill. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Since time of flight is the criteria for indoor freeflight, is it possible to establish beginner, intermediate, advanced and master classes (for say EZB), advancing to the next level by achieving a consistent record of flight time for a particular type and category of space? It would have to allow for different levels of ability or &quot;talent&quot; by letting the modeler choose the class he/she wishes to compete in but from which he has to achieve the required level to advance.
