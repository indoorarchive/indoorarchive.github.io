I may be partly responsible for Nick's feelings about experts and MS 
<br />
bracing. At St. Lukes last month I had a new F1L with a MS that was 
<br />
longer than what I usually use. It was deflecting so much that I 
<br />
couldn't find a trim where the model would fly at launch torque and at 
<br />
cruise torque. I consulted my AMA EZB rules that said that any bracing 
<br />
must be wood and made a hasty triangular MS brace out of balsa that 
<br />
stopped the deflection and made the model flyable.
<br />
<br />When I got home I read the F1L rules and found that such an arrangement 
<br />
is specifically forbidden so that was the end of that idea. I understand 
<br />
from private discussions that the use of wood bracing on an EZB is also 
<br />
verboten. But in the case of EZB it's forbidden because that's the way 
<br />
people have interpreted the rules - not because of what's written in the 
<br />
rules. I think the EZB rules should be cleaned up but that's a different 
<br />
discussion.
<br />
<br />As far as bracing adjustment goes I don't agree with Nick that bracing 
<br />
is hard to figure out. If your MS deflects so much that your model dives 
<br />
into the floor then a simple brace to strengthen it will probably fix 
<br />
the problem.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am wondering if this is an instance of the chicken coming before the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; egg. When I first started flying the idea of using the bracing wire to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some adjust the launch did not come naturally. To me bracing was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something that you made as stiff as you can so the stick was stiff. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is not what the motor stick bracing wire on most indoor models is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; used for. The bracing functions as an adjustment stop to limit the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deflection of the motor stick.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now what separates the experts from the beginners with regard to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bracing motor tubes is the ability to select a motor stick that has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the right spring constant to allow the motor stick to come back to its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unloaded shape at the right moment in the flight. What many F1D flyers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are trying to do is to get the right amount of down thrust and wing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wash to control the launch and then have the motor stick spring back 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as soon as the down thrust and wing wash are no longer required so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the model can fly as efficiently as possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Changing the rules may help beginners get their launches right, with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the stipulation that they can figure out how much slack to use in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bracing. However, they are still going to have to be able to select 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wood that is light enough and stiff enough not to spend half the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flight with an extra 3 degrees of down thrust.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have definitely wanted to brace a Ministick motor stick or two that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were giving me trouble. Generally, the motor sticks were too weak to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have been competitive with properly built models even if they had been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; braced. I think experienced flyers who understand bracing wire are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seeking to add a feature that will help the enlighten fix a motor 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stick that is just barely off, far more than a way to make an event 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more appealing to a newcomer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I tend to agree that an LPP without any composite technology or a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ministick is the way to go.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt; The first thing I discovered when I started flying F1D is that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     F1D is a lot easier to launch than the &quot;beginner&quot; models I fly. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     have spent a lot of time on EZB, F1L, and Limited Pennyplane
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     (LPP). Raise your hand if you have had your EZB or F1L dive on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     launch because the motor stick was too flexible? (Both mine are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     raised.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt; In an ironic way, we have made our beginner models harder to fly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     than F1D. Of course, we know one reason -- a solid wood motor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     stick is easy to build but it generally does not work well under
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     high torque and tension of the rubber motor.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt; Bracing a solid motor stick is relatively easy to do, whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     using wood bracing or thread. Bracing substantially increases the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     performance of the motor stick. Not only will this help to make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     these beginner models launch better, allowing bracing means the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     quality of the solid motor stick does not have to be as good.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Hobby shop balsa can be used. A lighter MS can be used, and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     weight budget can be used elsewhere. These all greatly lower the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     barrier of entry for the beginner -- YET, these effects increases
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     the performance of the model for the beginner. You don't usually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     find these &quot;win-win&quot; scenarios.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;     &gt; &gt; I may be stepping on Kang's toes a little here but he and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     had almost the exact same thought about a way to make beginner
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     events easier. Since I thought of it yesterday I'm adopting it as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     my idea.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;     &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;     &gt; &gt; The rules for LPP, F1L, EZB and A6 say the MS has to be solid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     wood and in different ways and to different extents pretty much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     rule out any sort of bracing. Making a MS work correctly and not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     weigh too much is one of the hardest parts of building any of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     these models. It's a part of building that requires the most care
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     in wood selection and building experience. It's probably one of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     the main reasons why experienced flyers have such an edge in these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     events.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;     &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;     &gt; &gt; So this may be blasphemy but why not pick one or two of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     events and say that the MS still has to be solid wood but you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     brace it. The bracing could be limited to thread or wood or you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     could just leave it open for people to experiment with.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;     &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;     &gt; &gt; The people who have successfully conquered the MS problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     wouldn't have to change anything and would probably still win but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     the beginning flyers would have a much better chance of building a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     flyable model to the minimum weight.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;     &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;     &gt; &gt; I've seen a few beginning indoor flyers who have spent a lot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     of time building a model but just get really demoralized when they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     couldn't make it fly. Having this type of experience is not good

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     for keeping people interested.
