Eze Dope has no smell and is fairly thick. I applied it both full strength and 50/50 with water. In both cases it did a great job of shrinking the tissue. It does have issues and Deluxe said they are working on them and will contact me when they think they have cleared them up.
<br />
<br />Using Eze Dope with Tissue Paste you have to wait over a day for the Tissue Paste to dry properly otherwise Eze Dope will break the bond between the tissue and the wood.
<br />
<br />Drying time of Eze Dope is fairly rapid in both cases but it leaves brush strokes (their working on this) and looks like if flows smoothly both full strength and 50/50. The strokes show up once it has dried.
<br />
<br />Tissue Paste is a thick paste which has a screw top applicator which is good for 1/8 and larger stripwood but you need to apply it with a brush with smaller sizes. I found it was best to put the paste on part of the area you wished to cover, lay the tissue on that part with the rest of the tissue folded back. Then cover the balance of the stripwood with Paste and pull the tissue over that. It drys very fast if you have a thin layer. If you use wet tissue it reactivates.
<br />
If you use the Eze Dope too soon it will react with the paste and loosen it's hold on the wood. That's why you have to wait at least a day before applying the dope. I did not have any problems if I used 50/50 white glue or Future floor wax with the Tissue Paste lifting after it had dried for 2 hours.
<br />
<br />Cover Grip (for plastic coverings) no smell goes on and dries quickly, but I let it set for at least 30 minutes before applying the covering. It is very thick and I haven't tested to see if it works as well thinned 50/50 with water. I used my trimming iron set at 1/2 the heat setting (about 200 degrees F) and got a better seal than with self sealing covering or any other brush on plastic covering glue. It formed a tight bond with my polyspan lite and did not lift when I applied Eze Dope, 50/50 white glue or Future floor wax.
<br />
<br />I use their Super 'Phatic glue for all construction unless epoxy is required and find it to be an excellent product far superior to other glues in its class. None of their tested products loosened the grip of the Super 'Phatic glue.
<br />
<br />To sum up I rate Super 'Phatic a 5 of 5, Cover Grip 5 of 5, Tissue Paste 3 of 5, and Eze Dope 4 of 5.
