Although I won't be building an EZB in the foreseeable future, I applaud Kang for creating what sounds like a fun, interesting &amp; unusual challenge. I hope a lot of people give it a try. Perhaps some existing floppy motor sticks could be braced &amp; returned to competition. I assume it is clear that braced motor stick EZB's could not be legally flown in an official AMA sanctioned EZB contest.
<br />
Kang, I hope you intend to put the plans for 0.24 g EZB in the files soon &amp; a components list with sizes &amp; weights would really be interesting!
<br />
Thanks,
<br />
Gary Hodson

<br />
This is a proposal.  Please provide your feedback.  I will start this challenge after considering your feedback.
<br />
<br />===========================================
<br />
<br />A Braced EZB Challenge: Fun, Glory, and $$
<br />
<br />Background:  The EZB event was originally introduced in 1961 as an entry level event, a &quot;dumbed down&quot; version of the many complex microfilm and paper models flown at that time.  It quickly gained popularity because it was easier and quicker to build.   At first, the EZB model weighed around 2.0 g, and it was a sturdy model.  Competition pressure would quickly bring the weight down.  In 1968, Jim Richmond's Kokomo Bomber EZB weighed a svelt 0.74g.  Model weights remained in the 0.75 g to 1.2 g range for the next 25 years.  In the early 1990's Larry Coslick and Walt Van Gorder brought down the EZB weight to near 0.5 g.  Throughout the 1990's, the EZB was often the most popular event flown at USIC, with nearly 100 contestants.
<br />
<br />Today, the EZB is not a popular event.  It is one of the least popular events.  In order to be competitive at the national level, an EZB must weigh 0.45 g or less.   Recently, the AMA Cat IV record was set using a 0.24 g EZB!
<br />
<br />The EZB model becomes more challenging to build and fly when it is around 0.5g and below.  Many can't or decide not to build so light.  But perhaps a bigger challenge is that the light EZB is often plagued by a motor stick that is not stiff enough.  Instead of adding positively to the challenge, the weak motor stick becomes a cause of frustration and a barrier to continued effort.
<br />
<br />By rule, the EZB motor stick must be solid wood, which means bracing is not allowed.  This rule makes the EZB motor stick easy to build.  But there is a caveat.  You can't just use any motor stick you cut up.   Because the motor stick must be light, yet strong, you have to go through many candidate sticks.  We have heard of the travails of many EZB fliers who have gone through hundreds of motor sticks before finding one that is good enough.  This is one of the dues that the EZB flier must pay if he wants a good model.
<br />
<br />In contrast, an expert event like F1D uses a rolled motor tube for light weight, and the use of boron and bracing for added stiffness.  The resulting motor stick is light and incredibly stiff.  I have never heard of a F1D builder who has to go through hundreds of rolled tubes to find one that is stiff enough.  In fact, almost every rolled tube is sufficiently stiff once it is reinforced with boron and tightened with bracing.
<br />
<br />Proposed Challenge:
<br />
<br />This proposal allows the use of wood bracing to be added to the solid wood motor stick of the EZB.   The intent of this proposal is to remove the frustration of the weak motor stick so the EZB flier can focus on other aspects required for successful EZB flying.
<br />
<br />1. For any braced EZB model that passes the 30-minute mark, the flier will be added to the 30-minute EZB Club of A History of EZB Flights.  You will also receive $100 if your model weighs 0.6 g or above and $50 if your model weighs less than 0.6 g.  (One prize per person per model weight class.)
<br />
<br />2. The flier who has the highest time, regardless of model weight, will receive $250 and bragging rights.
<br />
<br />3. If your EZB breaks an AMA record (Cat I, II, III, IV), you will be added to the Record Club of A History of EZB Flights.  In addition, you will receive $100.  (One prize per person, per Category)
<br />
<br />4. All flights must be at a sanctioned contest or record trial.  Processing of model by contest director is required.  Photos of motor stick bracing must be provided.
<br />
<br />5. Models, bracing techniques, fliers, etc. will all be documented in an article to be submitted to Free Flight Quarterly.  Your glory will be widely known.
<br />
<br />6. The Braced EZB Challenge starts today and finishes September 30, 2013.
