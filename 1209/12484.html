Gary, 
<br />
<br />Yes that is what I am saying. Doesn't mean I have to be right on this point. It's design as a mechanism to keep the experts out of the event, Maybe there is a better way? Remember, we don't want beginners to stay beginners. By the time a newbie has progresses to having built several different types they are probably ready to join the grown ups table. 
<br />
<br />Reducing the weight to the modern penny is just a whimsical notion of mine. I'd like to see how a Penny Plane would perform at 2.5 grams. I also think it'd be a neat way for the Beginners to see how a model's weigh affects it's overall performance. It also makes it hard for experts to use their Beginner Penny Plane model in LPP

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Bill, 
<br />
So, a beginner by your definition could not fly A6 or mini Stick or any other AMA event? I assume you are referring to flying in a contest. If it is a beginner's event why would you lower the Novice PP minimum weight?

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Kang, 
<br />
<br />First let me apologize for hijacking your thread. We're really talking about two different things. I believe what you're suggesting is tweaking the rules of the current beginner events to make them easier to fly for beginners. Fair enough and good luck. 
<br />
<br />What I am proposing is an experiment. An event, maybe called Beginner Penny Plane, same rules as Novice Penny. I'd kinda like to see the minimum weight set at 2.5 grams rather than the pre 1984 penny weight of 3.1 grams but that's a minor point. 
<br />
<br />The point of the experiment is to see what happens if an event is &quot;protected&quot; from the experts. Chuck asked about how to determine who is a beginner and who is an expert. I think my suggestion that this be the only duration event the beginner could fly addresses this question. There is a system in place for the LPP Pro Am which also deals with this issue. I don't see someone who i s capable of flying F1D, EZB or Intermediate stick giving up the opportunity to fly those events just so they could steal the Beginner's trophy, If he or she does then we get to BOO them at the trophy ceremony. Oh and once you've won the Beginner event at the national level you don't get to fly it anymore. 
<br />
<br />I, also welcome specific criticism and suggestions 
<br />

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I think we need to move beyond the notion that &quot;experts will always beat beginners, therefore any rule change to level the playing field is futile.&quot; That notion is dogma at its worst and doesn't contribute in any positive way. 
<br />
<br />I welcome specific criticism and suggestions for improvement.
