Kang, 
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I realize you are fairly new to the hobby but have very rapidly progressed to an expert level. Yours in not the typical experience. 
<br />
<br /><br /><br />You talk about density and stiffness of motor sticks etc. The averag e beginner, the person we need to attract, doesn't yet understand these con cepts in a practical way  let alone need to be told not to worry about them as a beginner. 
<br />
<br /><br /><br />They need to get a model in the air that can fly more than 5 minutes and have some experts encourage him/her, not come right behind themn and triple their flight time. 
<br />
<br /><br /><br />The scenario has happened over and over again. A beg inner event is introduced and within a year the designs are so perfected and the trimming so perfect that no beginner ever wins the event again. 
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I think the current events are fine. I would just like to see a beginner event tha t stays a beginner event. 
<br />

<br />  
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The first thing I discovered when I started flying F1D is that a F1D is a lot easier to launch than the &quot;beginner&quot; models I fly. I have spent a lot of time on EZB, F1L, and Limited Pennyplane (LPP). Raise your hand if you have had your EZB or F1L dive on launch because the motor stick was too flexible? (Both mine are raised.) 
<br />
In an ironic way, we have made our beginner models harder to fly than F1D. Of course, we know one reason -- a solid wood motor stick is easy to build but it generally does not work well under high torque and tension of the rubber motor. 
<br />
Bracing a solid motor stick is relatively easy to do, whether using wood bracing or thread. Bracing substantially increases the performance of the motor stick. Not only will this help to make these beginner models launch better, allowing bracing means the quality of the solid motor stick does not have to be as good. Hobby shop balsa can be used. A lighter MS can be used, and the weight budget can be used elsewhere. These all greatly lower the barrier of entry for the beginner -- YET, these effects increases the performance of the model for the beginner. You don't usually find these &quot;win-win&quot; scenarios. 
<br />
