I am wondering if this is an instance of the chicken coming before the egg.
<br />
When I first started flying the idea of using the bracing wire to some
<br />
adjust the launch did not come naturally. To me bracing was something that
<br />
you made as stiff as you can so the stick was stiff. This is not what the
<br />
motor stick bracing wire on most indoor models is used for. The bracing
<br />
functions as an adjustment stop to limit the deflection of the motor stick.
<br />
<br />Now what separates the experts from the beginners with regard to bracing
<br />
motor tubes is the ability to select a motor stick that has the right
<br />
spring constant to allow the motor stick to come back to its unloaded shape
<br />
at the right moment in the flight. What many F1D flyers are trying to do is
<br />
to get the right amount of down thrust and wing wash to control the launch
<br />
and then have the motor stick spring back as soon as the down thrust and
<br />
wing wash are no longer required so that the model can fly as efficiently
<br />
as possible.
<br />
<br />Changing the rules may help beginners get their launches right, with the
<br />
stipulation that they can figure out how much slack to use in the bracing.
<br />
However, they are still going to have to be able to select wood that is
<br />
light enough and stiff enough not to spend half the flight with an extra 3
<br />
degrees of down thrust.
<br />
<br />I have definitely wanted to brace a Ministick motor stick or two that were
<br />
giving me trouble. Generally, the motor sticks were too weak to have been
<br />
competitive with properly built models even if they had been braced. I
<br />
think experienced flyers who understand bracing wire are seeking to add a
<br />
feature that will help the enlighten fix a motor stick that is just barely
<br />
off, far more than a way to make an event more appealing to a newcomer.
<br />
<br />I tend to agree that an LPP without any composite technology or a Ministick
<br />
is the way to go.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The first thing I discovered when I started flying F1D is that a F1D is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a lot easier to launch than the &quot;beginner&quot; models I fly. I have spent a lot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of time on EZB, F1L, and Limited Pennyplane (LPP). Raise your hand if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have had your EZB or F1L dive on launch because the motor stick was too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flexible? (Both mine are raised.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In an ironic way, we have made our beginner models harder to fly than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; F1D. Of course, we know one reason -- a solid wood motor stick is easy to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; build but it generally does not work well under high torque and tension of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the rubber motor.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Bracing a solid motor stick is relatively easy to do, whether using wood
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bracing or thread. Bracing substantially increases the performance of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; motor stick. Not only will this help to make these beginner models launch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better, allowing bracing means the quality of the solid motor stick does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not have to be as good. Hobby shop balsa can be used. A lighter MS can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; used, and the weight budget can be used elsewhere. These all greatly lower
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the barrier of entry for the beginner -- YET, these effects increases the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; performance of the model for the beginner. You don't usually find these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;win-win&quot; scenarios.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I may be stepping on Kang's toes a little here but he and I had almost
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the exact same thought about a way to make beginner events easier. Since I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought of it yesterday I'm adopting it as my idea.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; The rules for LPP, F1L, EZB and A6 say the MS has to be solid wood and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in different ways and to different extents pretty much rule out any sort of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bracing. Making a MS work correctly and not weigh too much is one of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hardest parts of building any of these models. It's a part of building that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; requires the most care in wood selection and building experience. It's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably one of the main reasons why experienced flyers have such an edge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in these events.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; So this may be blasphemy but why not pick one or two of these events
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and say that the MS still has to be solid wood but you can brace it. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bracing could be limited to thread or wood or you could just leave it open
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for people to experiment with.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; The people who have successfully conquered the MS problem wouldn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to change anything and would probably still win but the beginning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flyers would have a much better chance of building a flyable model to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minimum weight.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I've seen a few beginning indoor flyers who have spent a lot of time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; building a model but just get really demoralized when they couldn't make it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fly. Having this type of experience is not good for keeping people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interested.
