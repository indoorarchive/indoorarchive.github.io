<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br /><br />The first thing I discovered when I started flying F1D is that a F1D is a
<br />
lot easier to launch than the &quot;beginner&quot; models I fly. I have spent a lot of
<br />
time on EZB, F1L, and Limited Pennyplane (LPP). Raise your hand if you have
<br />
had your EZB or F1L dive on launch because the motor stick was too flexible?
<br />
(Both mine are raised.)
<br />
<br />In an ironic way, we have made our beginner models harder to fly than F1D.
<br />
Of course, we know one reason -- a solid wood motor stick is easy to build
<br />
but it generally does not work well under high torque and tension of the
<br />
rubber motor.
<br />
<br />Bracing a solid motor stick is relatively easy to do, whether using wood
<br />
bracing or thread. Bracing substantially increases the performance of the
<br />
motor stick. Not only will this help to make these beginner models launch
<br />
better, allowing bracing means the quality of the solid motor stick does not
<br />
have to be as good. Hobby shop balsa can be used. A lighter MS can be used,
<br />
and the weight budget can be used elsewhere. These all greatly lower the
<br />
barrier of entry for the beginner -- YET, these effects increases the
<br />
performance of the model for the beginner. You don't usually find these
<br />
&quot;win-win&quot; scenarios.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I may be stepping on Kang's toes a little here but he and I had almost the
</em><br />
exact same thought about a way to make beginner events easier. Since I
<br />
thought of it yesterday I'm adopting it as my idea.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The rules for LPP, F1L, EZB and A6 say the MS has to be solid wood and in
</em><br />
different ways and to different extents pretty much rule out any sort of
<br />
bracing. Making a MS work correctly and not weigh too much is one of the
<br />
hardest parts of building any of these models. It's a part of building that
<br />
requires the most care in wood selection and building experience. It's
<br />
probably one of the main reasons why experienced flyers have such an edge in
<br />
these events.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So this may be blasphemy but why not pick one or two of these events and
</em><br />
say that the MS still has to be solid wood but you can brace it. The bracing
<br />
could be limited to thread or wood or you could just leave it open for
<br />
people to experiment with.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The people who have successfully conquered the MS problem wouldn't have to
</em><br />
change anything and would probably still win but the beginning flyers would
<br />
have a much better chance of building a flyable model to the minimum weight.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've seen a few beginning indoor flyers who have spent a lot of time
</em><br />
building a model but just get really demoralized when they couldn't make it
<br />
fly. Having this type of experience is not good for keeping people
<br />
interested.
