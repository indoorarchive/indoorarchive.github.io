<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was directed to this group by John Kagen after writing him a couple 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of emails.
</em><br />
<br />Welcome to our world!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not alot of luck, broke as much as built. I started with some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Peck kits, those went well. But I have a million questions also. 
</em><br />
<br />Don't be discouraged. Try building heavier until you get the hang of
<br />
things, then go light and thin. Ministicks are fun, but I would go
<br />
with a larger model, perhaps a Limited Penny Plane, they are easier to
<br />
build in the beginning.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. Is the purpose to thinning Ambroid glue to lighten it? Does it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effect the strength that much?
</em><br />
<br />The idea is to use just enough glue to hold everything together. Extra
<br />
glue only adds weight without contributing anything. Don't use too
<br />
much glue. Some successful modelers don't think their glue very much.
<br />
I dilute about 50/50 ambroid with acetone.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. I see rubber strippers online. Are you stripping existing motors, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do you get wide lengths of rubber? I need some small motors for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ministicks, but havent seen anything as small as needed pre-stripped.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (1/32nd)
</em><br />
<br />Most folks purchase rubber in strips up to 1/4 inch and you strip it
<br />
to the desired size. You used to be able to buy stripped rubber from
<br />
Lew Gitlow, don't know if you can still buy it from him.
<br />
<br />If you are serious about indoor, it makes sense to buy a stripper.
<br />
There are several on the market, I like the one by Ray Harlan.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. What diameter circle should I expect for a Ministick, and a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; PennyPlane?
</em><br />
<br />Usually you adjust the circle so that it fits within your flying site.
<br />
You want it to fly in a circle that keeps it well away from the walls,
<br />
allowing for a little drift. Smaller circles can usually get closer to
<br />
the ceiling as well. However, two small circles can be tricky to trim
<br />
for and the flight won't be as long as with a larger circle.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4. I'm going to purchase some balsa as soon as I figure out &quot;grading, 
</em><br />
<br />If you go to a regular hobby store, expect to look through a lot of
<br />
wood to find something appropriate. You might want to buy some &quot;indoor
<br />
wood&quot;. I got some really nice wood from Lew Gitlow when I was starting
<br />
out and built my first to weight limited penny planes with it. It was
<br />
much easier to build and fly the model with good wood. Once you have a
<br />
feel for this, you can sort wood from your local hobby shop.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; weight and such. Do you store it flat, or on end?
</em><br />
<br />I store it flat.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5. Im going to have to buy some tools I think. any suggestions for:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a. Rubber stripper
</em><br />
<br />It's worth it to get a good one.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; b. balsa stripper(have a Master Airscrew, seems only &quot;o.k.&quot;)
</em><br />
<br />Ray Harlan's micrometer stripper is a great tool. I use it to cut
<br />
tapered spars. The Jim Jones style stripper (Tim Goldstein makes a
<br />
version, others do too) is great for stripping straight spars. Some
<br />
folks use it for tapers as well. You can also use some bits of razor
<br />
blades to make your own.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; c. gram scale
</em><br />
<br />You want something that weighs 0.01 grams. Some folks like 0.001 gram
<br />
resolution. You might check out police auctions for scales, drug
<br />
dealers often have really high end scales. These get auctioned off
<br />
after the trial. You can also make your own mechanical balance. Ray
<br />
Harlan has a nifty, inexpensive, spring scale, as well as a very nice
<br />
balance beam.
<br />
<br />Get a copy of Lew Gitlow's book. Check on eBay, occasionally a copy of
<br />
&quot;Building and Flying Indoor Model Airplanes&quot; will show up. If you can
<br />
get it inexpensively, then do, it's a great resource. also look at
<br />
<a href="http://www.indoornews.com/">http://www.indoornews.com/</a> it has plans and information on the forum.
<br />
It also has an archive of all of the messages on the old indoor yahoo
<br />
group.
<br />
<br />Another good resource is <a href="http://www.IndoorNewsAndViews.com/">http://www.IndoorNewsAndViews.com/</a> the
<br />
website that goes along with the &quot;Indoor News and Views&quot; newsletter.
<br />
INAV is full of articles and plans.
<br />
<br />Feel free to ask here, or to ask folks off-line. As you have found,
<br />
folks like John Kagan are happy to help when they have the time.
