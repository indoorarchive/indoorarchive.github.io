Unless I imagined the whole thing someone told me recently that Wright Stuff would not be a Science Olympiad Event in 2009. I can't remember where I heard that or who said it. Does anyone in this group know if this is true?
<br />
<br />And now for the disaster of the week:
<br />
I'm the EC for a regional competition Saturday at Emory University for 22 teams. I got an email from the Emory professor who organizes the events saying that he found out TODAY that we can't use the gym SATURDAY. But not to worry - he has moved the event into another room - a chemistry lecture theatre. The room has a sloping floor with desks fixed to the floor. At the low end of the sloping floor the ceiling height is about 18 feet. At the high end of the sloping floor the ceing height is about 10' (TEN FEET). Of course the usable flying height would be minus the height of the fixed desks. The width of the room is a whopping 50'. A model at the ceiling will have about 8 feet of vertical space for a descent before it hits the desks. I can't even imagine how this is going to go over with the good teams.
<br />
<br />Earlier this week the Chamblee HS team had their gym reserved for Wright Stuff practice. While they were preparing for their second test flight the gym filled up with people who apparently also had the gym &quot;reserved&quot;.  We had to stop after 2 flights.
<br />
<br />Also this week I had an email exchange with the Georgia state head of Science Olympiad who is running the state tournament in Augusta this year and the Nationals next year.. He spent a lot of energy telling me how much he hates Wright Stuff. He told me that it is useless for people to practice for Wright Stuff. He told me he was going to assign flight times to 30 teams in a time slot between 12:15 and 3:15. They can't even enter the gym before 12:00. 
<br />
<br />I'm actually about to the point where I hate Wright Stuff too.
