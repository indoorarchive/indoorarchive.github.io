The Chamblee team had another practice today and it went a little better. There were maybe 100 kids milling around in the gym but the science teacher was able to clear them off the floor for 2 test flights. The 2 flights were both shortened by wind from the A/C but still reached 3:14 and 3:08. The Chamblee LittleSquare flies much better than mine. It was built with the optional 8% airfoil, a triangular trailing edge and a rounded leading edge. It's built to the standard length shown on the plan. The prop is an Ikara SO with the trailing edge cut off behind the spar and set to 12 pitch. In the Cat 1 gym they launched at .21 in-oz and had .1 inch-oz at landing. My LittleSquare usually lands with .2 in-oz left. I'm jealous.
<br />
<br />Tomorrow we're supposed to have the gym for a few hours with no students at school and the A/C off. It should be fun for a change!

<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As a fellow Wright Stuff coach I can symphasise with you. When 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;we 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;reserve the school gym, often members of little kids basketball 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;groups 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;who have the gym reserved over an hour later come in early for 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;practice. It is no use asking the kids (or their parents) to use 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;just 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;one hoop in the corner. The WS team has to quit or risk the planes 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;being hit or run over. The regional site for last Saturday's 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;competition for the JV team had a ceiling height of just 14' and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;narrow 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;width. At least the students knew about this advance and could 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;practice for it. And, the Indiana state competition this year, at IU 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloomington, will not be able to use the usual sports pavillion (a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;76' 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;clear space to the girders) as the football team has it reserved, not 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;for use but as a backup in case it rains on their outdoor practice 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;field.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But with all these annoyances, there are good things, too. The 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;regional site for last Saturday's competition for the Varsity team 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;was 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a new multipurpose room in the new student center at IUPUI in 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Indianapolis. I was worried about a fourth floor room that was said 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;have a 21.5' ceilin and a 34' width. However, the room was a great 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;flying site. The room separation curtain was opened (into pockets in 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the wall) and the smallest dimension was actually more than 60' and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;ceiling where WS flew was closer to 24'. The best part was that the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;air was very, very good. The team flew much longer flights than they 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;ever flew in practice at that height in the school gym. The air, to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;me 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;at least, was better than that at the last year's Johnson City USIC. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was great seeing the smiles on the team's faces as their plane 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;flew 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;on and on, bumping the ceiling panel edges, falling several feet, and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;rising back up again and again.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So, even with all the adverse things that often happen in Wright 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuff, the good times make me sad that there probably will be a few 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;years without Science Olympiad Wright Stuff competition. I just hope 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that the local 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;high school keeps up with the informal flying club. I know I will 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;continue to help.
<br />
