<br />
Bill,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a fellow Wright Stuff coach I can symphasise with you.  When 
<br />
we 
<br />
reserve the school gym, often members of little kids basketball 
<br />
groups 
<br />
who have the gym reserved over an hour later come in early for 
<br />
practice.  It is no use asking the kids (or their parents) to use 
<br />
just 
<br />
one hoop in the corner.  The WS team has to quit or risk the planes 
<br />
being hit or run over.  The regional site for last Saturday's 
<br />
competition for the JV team had a ceiling height of just 14' and 
<br />
narrow 
<br />
width.  At least the students knew about this advance and could 
<br />
practice for it.  And, the Indiana state competition this year, at IU 
<br />
Bloomington, will not be able to use the usual sports pavillion (a 
<br />
76' 
<br />
clear space to the girders) as the football team has it reserved, not 
<br />
for use but as a backup in case it rains on their outdoor practice 
<br />
field.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with all these annoyances, there are good things, too.  The 
<br />
regional site for last Saturday's competition for the Varsity team 
<br />
was 
<br />
a new multipurpose room in the new student center at IUPUI in 
<br />
Indianapolis.  I was worried about a fourth floor room that was said 
<br />
to 
<br />
have a 21.5' ceilin and a 34' width.  However, the room was a great 
<br />
flying site.  The room separation curtain was opened (into pockets in 
<br />
the wall) and the smallest dimension was actually more than 60' and 
<br />
the 
<br />
ceiling where WS flew was closer to 24'.  The best part was that the 
<br />
air was very, very good.  The team flew much longer flights than they 
<br />
ever flew in practice at that height in the school gym.  The air, to 
<br />
me 
<br />
at least, was better than that at the last year's Johnson City USIC.  
<br />
It was great seeing the smiles on the team's faces as their plane 
<br />
flew 
<br />
on and on, bumping the ceiling panel edges, falling several feet, and 
<br />
rising back up again and again.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, even with all the adverse things that often happen in Wright 
<br />
Stuff, the good times make me sad that there probably will be a few 
<br />
years without Science Olympiad Wright Stuff competition.  I just hope 
<br />
that the local 
<br />
high school keeps up with the informal flying club.  I know I will 
<br />
continue to help.
<br />
<br />Leo
<br />
