<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I was directed to this group by John Kagen after writing him a 
</em><br />
couple 
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of emails.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Welcome to our world!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Not alot of luck, broke as much as built. I started with some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Peck kits, those went well. But I have a million questions also. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Don't be discouraged. Try building heavier until you get the hang of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things, then go light and thin. Ministicks are fun, but I would go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with a larger model, perhaps a Limited Penny Plane, they are easier 
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; build in the beginning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1. Is the purpose to thinning Ambroid glue to lighten it? Does it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; effect the strength that much?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The idea is to use just enough glue to hold everything together. 
</em><br />
Extra
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; glue only adds weight without contributing anything. Don't use too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much glue. Some successful modelers don't think their glue very 
</em><br />
much.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I dilute about 50/50 ambroid with acetone.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2. I see rubber strippers online. Are you stripping existing 
</em><br />
motors, or 
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; do you get wide lengths of rubber? I need some small motors for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ministicks, but havent seen anything as small as needed pre-
</em><br />
stripped.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (1/32nd)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Most folks purchase rubber in strips up to 1/4 inch and you strip it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the desired size. You used to be able to buy stripped rubber from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lew Gitlow, don't know if you can still buy it from him.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you are serious about indoor, it makes sense to buy a stripper.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are several on the market, I like the one by Ray Harlan.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 3. What diameter circle should I expect for a Ministick, and a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; PennyPlane?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Usually you adjust the circle so that it fits within your flying 
</em><br />
site.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You want it to fly in a circle that keeps it well away from the 
</em><br />
walls,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allowing for a little drift. Smaller circles can usually get closer 
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the ceiling as well. However, two small circles can be tricky to 
</em><br />
trim
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for and the flight won't be as long as with a larger circle.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 4. I'm going to purchase some balsa as soon as I figure 
</em><br />
out &quot;grading, 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you go to a regular hobby store, expect to look through a lot of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wood to find something appropriate. You might want to buy 
</em><br />
some &quot;indoor
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wood&quot;. I got some really nice wood from Lew Gitlow when I was 
</em><br />
starting
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out and built my first to weight limited penny planes with it. It 
</em><br />
was
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much easier to build and fly the model with good wood. Once you 
</em><br />
have a
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feel for this, you can sort wood from your local hobby shop.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; weight and such. Do you store it flat, or on end?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I store it flat.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 5. Im going to have to buy some tools I think. any suggestions 
</em><br />
for:
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a. Rubber stripper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's worth it to get a good one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; b. balsa stripper(have a Master Airscrew, seems only &quot;o.k.&quot;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ray Harlan's micrometer stripper is a great tool. I use it to cut
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tapered spars. The Jim Jones style stripper (Tim Goldstein makes a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; version, others do too) is great for stripping straight spars. Some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; folks use it for tapers as well. You can also use some bits of razor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; blades to make your own.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; c. gram scale
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You want something that weighs 0.01 grams. Some folks like 0.001 
</em><br />
gram
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resolution. You might check out police auctions for scales, drug
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dealers often have really high end scales. These get auctioned off
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after the trial. You can also make your own mechanical balance. Ray
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Harlan has a nifty, inexpensive, spring scale, as well as a very 
</em><br />
nice
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; balance beam.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Get a copy of Lew Gitlow's book. Check on eBay, occasionally a copy 
</em><br />
of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Building and Flying Indoor Model Airplanes&quot; will show up. If you 
</em><br />
can
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get it inexpensively, then do, it's a great resource. also look at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.indoornews.com/">http://www.indoornews.com/</a> it has plans and information on the 
</em><br />
forum.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It also has an archive of all of the messages on the old indoor 
</em><br />
yahoo
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; group.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another good resource is <a href="http://www.IndoorNewsAndViews.com/">http://www.IndoorNewsAndViews.com/</a> the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; website that goes along with the &quot;Indoor News and Views&quot; newsletter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; INAV is full of articles and plans.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Feel free to ask here, or to ask folks off-line. As you have found,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; folks like John Kagan are happy to help when they have the time.

Thanks for the warm welcome and questions answered Marty and Kurt.
<br />
I am building heavy. My first Ministick barely hold altitude, but it 
<br />
help me explore trim some. I was excited to see it do half circles in 
<br />
my basement. I have 2 Poonkers framed up with 1/32nd spars and ribs. 
<br />
also anothe Biscayne Baby(was my first one) I have to cover with 
<br />
kitchen wrap right now, seems light enough though.
<br />
The rubber stripper on A2Z site is too pricey for me right now. I did 
<br />
manage to strip a thin, about 1/32nd from a 1/8th&quot; piece of rubber 
<br />
with a razor blade for my Biscayne Baby. That was tedious, but worth 
<br />
while. I'll probably try that again.
<br />
I also have 2 Double Whammys framed up with curved ribs. My first one 
<br />
I ruined when I tried to tighten the tissue with a spritz of water.
<br />
(lesson learned!)
<br />
I am interested in F1D but I see I need to take some baby steps 
<br />
first. 
<br />
Im a career firefighter/paramedic, and I dont have a computer at 
<br />
home, so I have to surf here at the firehouse, so I can only bother 
<br />
you guys once every 3 days
<br />
Is anyone near Indianapolis, Indiana? I'd sure like to see some of 
<br />
this first hand. I have statred building some jigs and such for 
<br />
building props and dihedral. I am having to retool some. Seems 
<br />
nothing I have for RC is good for this stuff. Balsa at the LHS is 
<br />
awful, so I am going to have to buy some online. A2Z seems to have 
<br />
good stuff? What grain and weigh would be good in 1/32nd&quot; for 
<br />
MInisticks?
<br />
Thanks again,
<br />
Mark
