Trying to avoid a bitch session about SO, all I can say is I sympathise.
<br />
<br />But, I have some constructive comments on how to solve your scheduling 
<br />
issue.
<br />
<br />At some MI regionals and at the MI State tournament I have schedules 
<br />
almost that tight (but with a practice hour before, sorry) and here's 
<br />
how I manage.  
<br />
- First it takes a fairly large team of assistants.  Besides the event 
<br />
supervisor, you want one or two to checkin students, one or two to keep 
<br />
records, six timers (two teams of three) and whatever door guards are 
<br />
needed.  Depending on expertise you can get by with less.  You 
<br />
shouldn't take one of those positions, supervise and fill in as needed.
<br />
- Next, the teams HAVE to be scheduled, no walk in stuff.  I allow 
<br />
teams to reschedule, but it has to be to an empty slot.  I like to 
<br />
schedule two teams every fifteen minutes.  You could do the same in 12 
<br />
minutes. I've done as little as 2 every ten, THAT was a busy day.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Have teams show up 5-10 minutes early to process and set up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;-- If the space is large, split it in half and live with it.  No 
<br />
disqualification for leaving your half, but you must launch from 
<br />
there.  Watch the drift on this of course.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;-- If the space is small, run the teams overlapping.  First team 
<br />
winds and launches.  Second team winds during first teams flight.  
<br />
Launches as soon as first plane recovered.  First team winds for second 
<br />
flight... and so on.  I tend to be more liberal on total time 
<br />
violations in this situation, and it can be hectic, but it works.
<br />
<br />If everyone shows, it makes for a busy day, but seldom do all teams 
<br />
show.  You also have to be a bit rigorous on moving teams along, just 
<br />
keep in mind the SO 'equally unfair for all' principal.
<br />
<br />And of course it helps if the teams know how this is going to work 
<br />
before hand, so make up a one-pager note on the procedure and have the 
<br />
event organizers share it with the teams.
<br />
<br />In something like six years now of running large contests I can only 
<br />
remember once or twice where a mid-air or timing overlap may have 
<br />
disadvantaged a team.
<br />
<br />Still, better than no contest at all and far, FAR better than one run 
<br />
by someone unfamiliar with indoor flying.
<br />
<br />Good Luck,
<br />

&nbsp;He told me he was going to assign flight times to 30 teams in a time 
<br />
slot between 12:15 and 3:15. They can't even enter the gym before 
<br />
12:00.
