<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Make everyone build their planes from the same balsa, fly using the same rubber, and covered with the same material, wound with commercially available winders, flying without steering (because its free flight), and maybe you'll have a sport that beginners will feel more comfortable with. Otherwise it has prominent elements of Magic the Gathering or other collectable card games where whoever has the 'super rare' has a decided advantage....

<br />Sounds like a great new event.  Start it up and see if it works.
<br />
<br />I don't agree with overall assessment, though, but I can certainly see where it comes from.  
<br />
<br />People look at the top finishers and believe that the things they can see and measure are absolute requirements for being competitive, and that if they don't have them, there is no point in participating.  5/99 rubber, y2k2 film, a Wilder winder, super balsa.
<br />
<br />These are beneficial, true, but to a much smaller degree than people realize.  It is a matter of diminishing return on investment.  Or, in other words, if you are at 27 minutes in F1D, there are things you can do that will make a far bigger difference in your times.
<br />
<br />As an example, before the last F1D team selection I tested the latest batches of Super Sport and decided that I still liked my 5/99 better.  But, only by a little bit.  The times I did with Super Sport would still have put me on the team.  Not because I have some special gift, but because I have put in the effort on all the other, higher value, elements of my program, like anyone can.
<br />
<br />Once you have all those details worked out, then you will be at a level where you may benefit from the last few percentage point differences.  And, you will have probably invested enough time by then that you will have had to the opportunity to collect some of the more rare elements anyway.  They are out there.  Rubber, covering, winders.  In a weird way, finding a treasure like that is part of the challenge and fun.
