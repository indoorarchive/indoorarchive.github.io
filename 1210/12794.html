I have been very interested in trying my hand at flying indoor duration for many years but never got around to it. When I discovered that Mark Bennett and others were flying in Beatrice, NE. I decided to make the trip down from Lincoln with my wife to watch the activities. 
<br />
<br />I wasn't able to attend until late Sunday afternoon so upon arrival there were 3 individuals still flying their models. I previously had been in Contact with Mark about the fly-in and I was hoping that Mark was still there, which he was.
<br />
<br />I've enjoyed watching Indoor models ever since observing the indoor nationals which were held in Lincoln, NE at Pershing Auditorium many, many years ago. I have always wanted to build and fly an indoor model but never got around to it because of work and too many other hobbies.
<br />
<br />Mark upon meeting me went out to his car and brought in an LPP and spent the next 45 minutes of his time showing me how to assemble the model and then proceeded to hand the plane over to me to try and ready it for flight without destroying it in the process. 
<br />
<br />With shaking hands and bad eyesight (forgot my reading glasses) and numerous attempts and encouragement from Mark the model was made almost ready to fly. My stress-level began to really escalate as Mark showed me how to wind the motor and handed the winder to me to complete the process. 
<br />
<br />Walking out to the middle of the floor to release the model made me feel like I was walking across a frozen lake. Every step I took I could see the wing-covering move from the air resistance I created. My stride went down to what felt like a few inches per step.
<br />
<br />Once we were positioned at the center of the flying area mark told me to release the prop and give the model a very slight push. To my total amazement the craft left from my fingers and began to slowly circle gaining altitude. I watched as the model floated in the air like a butterfly. 
<br />
<br />Mark having allowed me to ready the model and actually fly it gave me a totally new perspective. Watching indoor-models in person or on video is wonderful but actually flying one is totally awe-inspiring. I couldn't wait to get home to begin planning how I could go about building my own model. 
<br />
<br />I really appreciate the time Mark and others took talking to me at the event. The indoor bug has hooked me once again but this time I plan to actually attempt to build something.  I hope to have a model I can take to Beatrice the next time indoor folks go flying there. Hopefully it will actually fly.
