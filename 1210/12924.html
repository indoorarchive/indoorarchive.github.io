My turn to chime in...the basis of indoor modelling lately is &quot;Lighter  
<br />
Models Fly Longer&quot;...or so it seems.  The F1L's, etc. have a weight  limit so 
<br />
that might be a discriminator.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
If everyone had the ability to buy a &quot;Kagan VP Prop&quot; then that doesn't make 
<br />
&nbsp;the model any lighter, but if everyone had one, then the playing field is  
<br />
level.  KLind of like outdoor FF whre if everyhone flew a Nelson Belchfire  
<br />
.XXX in that event...the playing field is leveled and the only thing left 
<br />
is  design and trim...which is the cut.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Now, if I had the opportunity to buy a Kang milligram EZB...well....that  
<br />
might be tempting.  Last time I flew with him, he had half the number of  
<br />
ribs as my Hobby Shopper, but the rest of the model was carefully constructed  
<br />
with things I could get.  Yup, he did a LOT better than I did.  But it  
<br />
showed me where the discriminator was....not the rubber or much else, but his  
<br />
ability to built lighter and stiffer and etc. There was nothing on his EZB 
<br />
out  of my reach.  If he had a VP prop on it and I could get one commercially, 
<br />
I  probably would get it...IF it meant that it was needed to win.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
But, if one told me I needed a machine shop to make one...well, have a good 
<br />
&nbsp;time and I will settle for 5th place.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
So...when discussing the BOM...keep in mind what it is trying to do.   Back 
<br />
when the BOM rule was pretty much the standard, juniors made up the bulk of 
<br />
&nbsp;the flyers and daddyo made many of those models..thereby skewing the 
<br />
results of  daddy's models having fewer warps, etc and probably flew 
<br />
better...along with  daddy trimming them too.  I competd against many of those daddy 
<br />
builts and  got frustrated.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Times have changed.  Many components are commercially available today  that 
<br />
don't give an exceptional advantage over the nest flyer.  Lightweight  
<br />
films, better rubber, adhesives, etc only contribute to a lighter model.   If I 
<br />
can do away with thye BOM...then I can't buy one from Kang...but being able  
<br />
to buy a VP prop (minimal weight impact), film, rubber like anyone 
<br />
else...the  playing field is still level.  And, how about prop hangers...?  I'd  
<br />
rather buy mine, but Bill Leppard showed me how to wrap one with 
<br />
wire...Oh...and  I didn't make the wire either.  Falls back on model design and  
<br />
configuration, right?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The rest is up to me.  Figure out where the line wants to be based  upon 
<br />
the parameters that give the advantage.  The Dale Wisnewski's of the  speed 
<br />
world made their own engines too.  Eventually the commercial world  came up to 
<br />
them.

So yes here's a little problem, and  here I need suggestions for better 
<br />
defining a BOM intention consistent with  the rest of it.
<br />
Thanks,&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br /><br />However &quot;the rest of it&quot; means  that pre-cut/shaping of any individual 
<br />
component is allowed.  So maybe  not possible (with consistency) to limit carbon 
<br />
at any stage of reworking,  since it's always part resin, &quot;adhesive&quot; being 
<br />
the defining hinge for  everything else.
