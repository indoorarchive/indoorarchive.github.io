BTW, Yahoo email delivery has been running 5-10 hours behind the time posts are sent by posters, so (for those getting inbox delivery) the conversation has been choppier than usual.  If you wish to see posts in the order they occur, as well as the earliest possible publishing (in a few cases, 5-10 hours earlier) simply bookmark the Home Page, this, <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Indoor_Construction/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Indoor_Construction/</a>
<br />
You could also bookmark the separate messsage board instead.  However, the Home Page features a handy, clickable header that can take you to &quot;New Photos&quot;, &quot;New Files&quot;, &quot;New Members&quot; etc.

<br />Summary concept about carbon formed components in future BOM proposal:
<br />
The legality of any pre-made components is to hinge around the easy-enough-to-judge concept &quot;attachment/connection/adhesion/binding.&quot;  Builder/competitor performs all attachments, connections, bindings, insertions,  such as, but not limited to gluing of any wood component to other component, (or to itself, such as a tube seam) any covering adhesive, any thread or fiber binding, any paper binding, any wire attachment, boron component attachment, carbon component attachment. No restriction are imposed concerning the pre-cutting, pre-shaping of any individual component of wood, wire, metal, paper, plastic, boron, carbon, fiberglass.  Although dry carbon fiber as well as resin-impregnated carbon is more or less a raw material for model building purposes, the legality of a premade carbon component cannot be defined in terms of it &quot;having adhesive&quot; since some carbon includes adhesive in its manufacture process. Rather, carbon structures are defined in terms of their being a &quot;single component&quot;, and this aspect requires interpretation. Two interpretation examples: a carbon tube (such as for a prop hub) would be legal, but cannot be pre-connected to anything else. A carbon screw arm should be considered a single component, regardless of constuction complexity or internal laminations.  However, said screw holder cannot be pre-attached to a prop hub or any other component (including the screws it is designed to hold. But per the &quot;shaping&quot; allowance above, screw holes can be predrilled.)

<br />
Currenly thinking about fiberglass and foam.  Don't want to make separate rules for fiberglass or foam.  Ideally, they should fit the above two concepts, for simplicity.  Seems fiberglass should be treated just as carbon.  (Although model builders don't use fiberglass in prepreg form, it's still &quot;glue by nature.&quot;)  Is foam a threat to BOM?  What if someone showed up with a 3D printer formed foam LPP, and said it fits this BOM rule?  Would anyone care? Probably not right there, but what about HLG wings?
