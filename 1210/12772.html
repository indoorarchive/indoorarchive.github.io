<br />Hi Mark,
<br />
<br />The rule interpretation works quite well in practice.  The wording is already vague, and the interpretation does a nice job of fitting a reasonable understanding into the existing text.  It certainly could be written better, but of all the things we have to worry about, this ain't near the top of the list IMO.
<br />
<br />However, if your hobby is to debate linguistics, separate from the benefit or consequence of the ruling, I think your argument has a few gaps.
<br />
<br />&quot;&#x2026;all steering shall be done from the front end of the model and never from behind.&quot;
<br />
<br />What is the definition of &quot;front end&quot;?
<br />
<br />Does it mean forward of the mid-point?  If so, pushing on the back of the wing should be acceptable.
<br />
<br />Does it mean the absolute most forward part of the model?  If so, then we should be steering from the front of the prop, not rearward of it.
<br />
<br />Does it mean vaguely somewhere in the general vicinity of frontward portion of the area around the wing leading edge, but not necessarily as far forward as the prop?  If so, you are gleening much more information from those few words than I am.
<br />
<br />&quot;&#x2026;and never from behind.&quot;
<br />
<br />This isn't actually the opposite of the &quot;front of the model&quot;, which further calls into question what &quot;front end&quot; was intended to mean.  If &quot;front end&quot; was intended to mean either the front half or the forward most part, or even &quot;somewhere around the front&quot;, then this should have said &quot;&#x2026;and never from the rearward half of the model&quot;.
<br />
<br />&quot;Behind&quot; what?  Behind the whole model, so it is only illegal to push on the most rearward part of the stab?  Behind anything that you can push on?  So steering behind the prop really should be illegal?
<br />
<br />Bottom line, interpreting the wording to mean &quot;you can't push on any part (other than the prop), but you can push the boom in front of the stab&quot; is no more offensive to me than was the previous &quot;prop steering only&quot; interpretation.
<br />
<br />If the wording was more clearly stated, I might agree that it needed to be changed to facilitate the recent interpretation.  But it isn't.
<br />
<br />I think you are just outraged that something changed, regardless of how or why.  And that's ok &#x2013; it is human nature :)
