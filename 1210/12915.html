impossible, at least very hard. &gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Interesting that BOM concept wasn't considered &quot;very hard, impossible&quot; for decades, or at least it functioned as well as many other competition rules (meaning occasional controversy.)   Obviously a driving factor today is those flyers who desire to BAM as much as possible instead of BOM as much as possible--with various valid reasons.  The march of technology is another driver, but that not so much with indoor, so far. Adherence to BOM concept never has been very provable, but provability is to be distinguished from enforcability. Some of this (esp. yesteryears) was thanks to shared culture and tacit peer pressure.  Not a perfect  enforcement, obviously, there is a difference between functional enforcement and absolute provability of violation. Maybe today, peer trust ought not be considered a valid tool, I don't know.
<br />
<br />IDEA.   
<br />
Here's my outline toward defining, writing this impossible-to-be-sensible BOM rule.  This is not necessarily &quot;traditional&quot; but could be functional for our purposes, and pretty simple to understand/apply in all cases I can think of. The following is not proposed rule wording, just explanation.
<br />
<br />BOM: &quot;Construction of model&quot; by the competitor hinges around his/her performing ALL adhesive and attachment functions in the construction of model.  The flyer is to be the applicator of all adhesives or any methods of attaching any two previously separated components.
<br />
Examples, flyer could buy/obtain pre-bent wing tips and spars, ribs, but such components cannot be attached to each other except by flyer. Flyer could buy/obtain preshaped, pre-twisted sheet prop blades but again these could not be pre-attached to spars, nor the shaft wire pre-installed, except by builder/competitor.  The above allows purchase/obtaining of already cut, shaped components, provided no adhesive is present in such cut/shaped component, (ie. carbon component molding requires additional adhesive, to be performed by builder/competitor.)  Summary: attachment of any component to any other component, including thread, wire, boron, carbon, tissue, film, plasic, aluminum, wood, is to be performed only by competitor/builder.  &quot;Anything else goes.&quot;
