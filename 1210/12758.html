<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Aki, What the FAI Sporting Code seems to say and what is allowed can apparently diverge, such as (if I understand correctly) the current practice of steering the tailboom in competition.
</em><br />
<br />Both examples involve rules that are subject to further interpretation.  &quot;seems to say&quot; is the key phrase.  However, the situations are at opposite ends of the spectrum.
<br />
<br />&quot;Boom steering&quot; is the result of a deliberate, thought-out interpretation of the steering rules.  The relevant section states, &quot;&#x2026;all steering shall be done from the front end of the model and never from behind.&quot;  
<br />
<br />As the ruling was described to us at the one of the previous WC's, the written rule was interpreted to mean that we couldn't push on the back of the wing or stab, but we could steer from the front side (end) of the wing or stab, including the boom area in front of the stab.
<br />
<br />I presume the reason for this is to prevent a competitor from pushing the model and thus gaining altitude.  I won't say it is impossible (I'm sure someone could figure out a way), but it is difficult to increase altitude by pushing on the side of the boom.  The technique also avoids bumping and changing the VP mechanism.  Interestingly, it is easy to raise or lower the model, and bump the prop to lower pitch, by steering the back side of the propeller.  I'd say that we should only be allowed to steer by pushing the boom, if only there was a way to do it at high altitude.
<br />
<br />Use of pre-built VP hubs, on the other hand, is a situation that is in need of an interpretation (I'm not aware of any ruling on this issue, anyway).  
<br />
<br />The complication on the written rule is that there isn't a clear delineation between what is allowed and what isn't.  There is a spectrum starting with the most basic building materials and ending with completely built models.
<br />
<br />I don't think we need to wait until someone wins with a purchased hub to get a ruling.  I also don't think there is a general consensus currently allowing the practice at the WC.  I'd be surprised if anywhere close to 50% of the WC competitors used purchased hubs (we ought to do a survey to find out for sure).
<br />
<br />Not that it matters (it is up to the ruling body, acting on our protest and arguments), but my personal opinion is that purchased hubs are on the &quot;not allowed&quot; side, and a Harlan prop hanger is just barely across the &quot;allowed&quot; side.  There is far too much skill, experience, and knowledge incorporated into a purchased VP hub.
<br />
<br />All the molded carbon and machined aluminum components in a competition F1B add up to a model that would be very difficult for someone to build on their own, so I can understand the argument for abandoning the BOM rule there.  But, an F1D VP (even Treger's composite interpretation of Hunt's design) is still well within the reach of anyone with Indoor skills.
