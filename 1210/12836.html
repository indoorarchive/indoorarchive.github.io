<br />Hogwash.
<br />
<br />A) Composite construction is only difficult for people like you and me who don't know how to do it (yet).  Talk to the people who know how to vacuum bag a sailplane wing, and they will look at you crazy if you suggest they make a built-up wing.
<br />
<br />B) Composite construction (really, &quot;carbon/fiberglass/epoxy composite construction&quot;) has not proven itself superior, and thus required.  Schramm's VP hub is not composite.  Treger's prop blades and model are not composite.  Gabriella's model is not composite.  They are at the top of the heap.
<br />
<br />Let's keep the discussion on track, and not tangent off onto things that are not broken.
<br />
<br />The original question is which side of the BOM rule does a VP hub fall.  Is anyone trying to claim that a VP is not complex enough to violate BOM?  This question requires a rule interpretation.
<br />
<br />The morphed question is whether we should have the BOM rule at all for F1D.  If F1D were a beginner event, or if it was inaccessible in some way, then maybe.  But it is not either one.  Eliminating BOM would require a rule change proposal.
