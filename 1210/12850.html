It seems like we have a consensus about what we would like happen with regard to using purchased hubs in competition, and for once the current rule seems to agree with what most people want so how do we enforce it?
<br />
<br />For clarification sake, my reference to the cost and effort required to copy a Treger hub was based on a true copy of the real thing. That means custom Dural screws, milled carbon arm, correctly formed fiberglass tubes (I'm still not sure what makes his fiberglass so shinny without adding undue weight) and vacuum bagged screw holder. Of course it still has to come out at 90gm. That means a vacuum bagging set-up $500, a metal lathe $650 and a milling machine $1200 then another $300 or so for the stuff to make jigs and the actual hubs. Those are all estimates, however they are based on my experience of trying to literally copy the real thing. I'd say that's slightly out of the spectrum of a normal hobbyist workshop. 
<br />
<br />I'm not saying anyone needs to copy Treger to be successful or that its the best thing to do. I am saying that his hubs are the Ferraris of the indoor world. Many people will buy them but few will make something that is equal in quality and performance. 
<br />
<br />PS I actually like the BOM rule.
