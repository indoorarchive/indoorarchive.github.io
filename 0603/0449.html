Don,
<br />
Have you read Joe Maxwell's little book about balsa? If my memory is correct, he as done 
<br />
nearly what you are suggesting. All of his data are empirical but his conclusion is that as 
<br />
density increases so does stiffness. the increase in stiffness is not linear and increases at a 
<br />
rate that is greater than the density increase. 
<br />
The practical application of this phenomena is that a  cross section of lower density can be 
<br />
&quot;traded&quot; against  one of smaller cross section and higher density (stiffness) resulting in a 
<br />
structural member that meets the design deflection with lower weight. I recall that, for this 
<br />
reason, Joe stated that 5.5# balsa is optimal for F1D spars.
<br />
Tom
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I  have never heard of Bernard Hunt's SC formula as being the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; established indoor &quot;standard&quot; for grading balsa. It is simply a tool 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; used in selecting the wood and should be treated as such. If Tim grades 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all his sheets using the same (modified) formula then  I have no issue 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with that.   I know that good 6# wood was about 100 SC and average was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about 80 using Bernards scale. If you tested 4# wood and got 100SC then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that was bad 4# wood, 130 was good 4# wood.  The scale shifted based on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; density.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    If you are seriously wanting to make a better SC calculation then I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a few ideas which I never followed thru on.  I was going to test 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about several hundred samples  of wood in various ranges from 4# to 7# 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of similar size. I typically cut sheets into 18 x 1 sheets. Then based 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the buckling load, back out the Elastic modulus. Then calculate the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;beam stiffness&quot; which is E x I . Then plot the  elastic modulus vs 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; density and the &quot;beam stiffness&quot; as a function of density. I then was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going to hope that a nice relationship would fall out where one could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predict estimated &quot;normal&quot; E values based on density. And actually I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would prefer EI function based on density as the amount a beam (spar) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deflects is proportional to EI. So I had hoped that a corrolation could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be made (mathematically) so one could say a .030 x .060 spar of 130 SC 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4# wood is equal in strength (meaning deflection in this case) of .030 x 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; .060 SC100 5# wood.  That way you can decide in real world numbers that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if I use average 5# wood,  then this piece of 4# wood when cut the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; size will have the same strength but be 80% of the weight. Bernards 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculation does not do that. I also know he tested mostly 1/8 x 1/4 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strips as I have a tube with about 20 of them in it he sent me. He was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very fond of his Jim Jones balsa stripper and told me it was a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; convenient size to use.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The method they used is an engineering method (Euler buckle load) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but the actual SC formula they came up with was not based on an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; established engineering method of &quot;Stiffness Coefficient&quot; it was a term 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they created and derived themselves. That is why Tim modifying it is not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an issue as the SC is an arbitrary unit and he used the same unit for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all his sheets and defines his grades accordingly. Elastic modulus is an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; establish engineering term and is calculated  based on a formula. If you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fudge that formula then I can see a complaint. But right now a unit of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'SC' is no more defined than a unit of 'snuzzleflubbery'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       I have always treated SC this way since the beginnig. It was a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nice way to sort wood. I use to buy like 50 sheets of  3&quot; x 36&quot; x 1/16 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and 1/8 wood from SIG (contest grade) Cut it up into 1&quot; x 18&quot; pieces, so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I woud have like 300 sheets of 1/8 and 300 of 1/16, then sit next to a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scale and push.  Say I wanted spars for a unbraced F1D (old rules is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when I did this). I would sort the wood by density into groups. Then get 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a rough estimate of what force I needed. Say better than averag 5# was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 300 grams of force, I would then load test all sheets in the 5# range. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then all sheets past 300grams were set aside, and graded further . I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quickly found that maybe about 5-10% of the SIG wood was good stuff 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SC&gt;115 for 5# density. Of those sheets I would then  calculate in more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; detail each sheets SC and density more accurately. If I got a good sheet 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then I would  split into 1/2&quot; strip and retest. About half would test 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; poor after splitting as a light sheet may have a few hard spots in it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; raising the stiffness.  It was a very long and labor intensive process. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I use to have boxes  and boxes full of poor wood strips. Once Tim 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; started grading I just bought his wood instead as it saved me hours of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time and money having him do it.  The reults of models built from his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wood are very well seen. My models are lighter and stiffer than before. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My father has noticed it as well. In fact my dad called me laughing one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; day as he tried to roll a motor tube from Tims wood for his Pennyplane 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and it was so stiff it cracked when tried to roll it. he had to use 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weaker wood to get it to roll.  I remember before Tim started selling 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; balsa that if you bought $1000 worth of wood you got about $300 of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; usable wood out of it.  Now who was taking advantage of who? If you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; returned it, you ran the risk of not being able to buy ever again from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them so you just ate the cost becasue there was no where else to buy it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from. If you buy $300 from Tim you get $300 of damn good wood.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Don

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of mechanical difference. But there have been standards established 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for structural materials. When the numbers are changed and advertised 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as the genuine article, who suffers and who benefits?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
