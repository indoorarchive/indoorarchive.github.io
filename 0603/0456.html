<br />
<br />*	    SNIP   If you are seriously wanting to make a better SC
<br />
calculation then I 
<br />
have a few ideas which I never followed thru on.  I was going to test 
<br />
about several hundred samples  of wood in various ranges from 4# to 7# 
<br />
of similar size. I typically cut sheets into 18 x 1 sheets. Then based 
<br />
on the buckling load, back out the Elastic modulus. Then calculate the 
<br />
&quot;beam stiffness&quot; which is E x I . Then plot the  elastic modulus vs 
<br />
density and the &quot;beam stiffness&quot; as a function of density. I then was 
<br />
going to hope that a nice relationship would fall out where one could 
<br />
predict estimated &quot;normal&quot; E values based on density. And actually I 
<br />
would prefer EI function based on density as the amount a beam (spar) 
<br />
deflects is proportional to EI. So I had hoped that a corrolation could 
<br />
be made (mathematically) so one could say a .030 x .060 spar of 130 SC 
<br />
4# wood is equal in strength (meaning deflection in this case) of .030 x 
<br />
.060 SC100 5# wood.  That way you can decide in real world numbers that 
<br />
if I use average 5# wood,  then this piece of 4# wood when cut the same 
<br />
size will have the same strength but be 80% of the weight. Bernards 
<br />
calculation does not do that. I also know he tested mostly 1/8 x 1/4 
<br />
strips as I have a tube with about 20 of them in it he sent me. He was 
<br />
very fond of his Jim Jones balsa stripper and told me it was a 
<br />
convenient size to use.
<br />

<br />
<br />Don,
<br />
<br />I am working on a spreadsheet, tailored to my own interests, that can be
<br />
analyzed for several mechanical properties; and yield useful information.
<br />
Right now, for me, the problem is a few learning curves; but I'm motivated.
<br />
There are some concerns I have with the suggested method and you might be
<br />
able to clarify.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Wouldn't testing in the actual size ranges we deal with be more accurate?
<br />
After all, the material is extremely variable, even 1-inch widths, and the
<br />
B-E Beams theory excludes anisotropic materials as well as buckling for this
<br />
reason. Drela pointed this out earlier. There are a slug of potential
<br />
variables when testing slender columns. The only reason the formulas can be
<br />
applied to wood is due to the built-in margins for conservative design. We
<br />
are looking at actual tests for the material on the limits of the Mo tables.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />The density range and size of material introduces some other properties,
<br />
also. I see a lot of elastic to plastic and back to original deformations. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />BTW, the H-T buckle test is useful for separating glider sheets, forms, and
<br />
other stuff from the handful it's identifying. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />
<br />Bruce in Seattle
