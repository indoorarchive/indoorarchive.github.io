Very, very good idea.  I wish you had done this a year ago.
<br />
I'm very new to indoor duration.  Came over from the RC ranks.
<br />
Started with my dauthers delta dart at an indoor rc flyin.  Got 
<br />
hooked and built a double whammy PP.  Took the next step and ordered 
<br />
some stuff from Lew.  Got his LPP,  palor mites and Ministick kits.  
<br />
Build his LPP.  It was easy to build,  but came out very heavy.  He 
<br />
had lazer cut ribs that were nice for a beginner, but way to strong 
<br />
and heavy.  His spars are now pre-stripped,  but again, very stiff 
<br />
and heavy.  Its a very simple,  older design, and I never got it to 
<br />
fly real well.
<br />
<br />I then built a Banks LPP on the recommedation of jhood.  Flew great 
<br />
right off the building board.  It came out a little heavy, but 
<br />
close.  The hardest thing for me as a newbi has been to not over 
<br />
build.  Its hard to get the mindset of light and stiff with very 
<br />
little glue will be strong enough for these planes.  I then built 
<br />
another one to try to save weight.  Went way to for the other way. 
<br />
(2.3 gr). Flys fine in low ceilings, but would probably suffer at 
<br />
high torque.
<br />
<br />I guess what I'm trying to say is,  a first kit that took all the 
<br />
guess work out of building would have been a very good thing.  Pre-
<br />
stripped spars of the right weight and stiffness are a must.  Pre-cut 
<br />
ribs would be nice.  The right boom is a must.  Props are a black 
<br />
art.  Any pre-fab there would really help a beginner.  I have found 
<br />
poly micro covering to be very easy.  Haven't tried any of the others.
<br />
<br />If you would like any input on some beta kits from a recent newbi,  I 
<br />
would gladly buy a few and report on how it goes.
