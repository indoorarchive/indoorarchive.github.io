This post might rub some people the wrong way but this is the way I
<br />
look at indoor flying. If you want to fly in indoor competition you've
<br />
got to spend some time, effort and a little money to figure out the
<br />
things you need to know and to develop the necessary skills. Like
<br />
anything else in life this process will be easier for some people than
<br />
it is for others.
<br />
<br />You've also got to face the fact that for some period of time (longer
<br />
for some of us) you'll get your butt beat by the people who are
<br />
farther along in this process.
<br />
<br />There are many events currently being flown that allow a newcomer to
<br />
build a model that flies acceptably well. My first Limited Pennyplane
<br />
would occasionally break 5 minutes and I thought that was a miracle. I
<br />
took that same LPP to USIC in 1999 and finished 37th out of 50 something.
<br />
<br />I'm currently building an A-6 that has lived in my head for awhile.
<br />
A-6 is (or was) conceived as a &quot;beginner&quot; event. I had to search
<br />
through every piece of balsa I own to find the materials I needed to
<br />
build the A-6 close to weight. Building it has not been much easier
<br />
than building an EZB or F1L. Does this mean we need to clamor for a
<br />
higher weight limit for the A-6? Not to me it doesn't! There are
<br />
plenty of people out there who are building A-6's to weight.
<br />
Eventually I want to be one of them and be able to give them a fight.
<br />
<br />If you want to fun-fly indoor models then why worry about rules? Just
<br />
build something and go fly and have a good time! If you want to fly in
<br />
indoor COMPETITION, then accept that until your desire to succeed
<br />
drives you to learn the things you need to know, you will probably not
<br />
have too many podium finishes. You'll probably find that as time goes
<br />
on the playing field will gradually start to seem more level - without
<br />
changing rules that others are happy with.
