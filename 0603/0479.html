<br />
I mostly agree with what Bill is saying. Diluting or tweaking the 
<br />
rules to make events &quot;easier&quot; conflicts with the nature of 
<br />
competition. If you don't want to engage competition then why enter 
<br />
in the first place? At some point a beginner has to learn how to 
<br />
adjust and fly an indoor model or he will just flounder, finally 
<br />
giving up entirely. Aren't most things &quot;hard&quot; because we haven't yet 
<br />
put out the effort to master the necessary skills to succeed? If you 
<br />
don't find these kinds of challenges to be &quot;fun&quot; then you won't find 
<br />
them to be &quot;fun&quot; no matter what event you build or how heavy the 
<br />
model is.
<br />
<br />Regarding Bill's statement that building an A-6 is almost as 
<br />
difficult as building F1L (or similar): After building an A-6 myself 
<br />
I would say that A-6 is not intrinsically &quot;hard to build&quot; or &quot;hard 
<br />
to build to weight&quot; but you do have to engage some of the realities 
<br />
of all indoor construction. Things like basic wood grading, 
<br />
stripping wood to some defined size, learning to use indoor glue 
<br />
(&quot;it's like water&quot;), handling the wood (breaks when you touch it). 
<br />
All of these are hurdles to beginners no matter what class is being 
<br />
constructed. 
<br />
<br />Over and over, classes are introduced that are targeted at beginners 
<br />
or are labeled &quot;fun&quot; events, but which paradoxically always include 
<br />
one or more big trip &amp; fall hazard for beginners or something that 
<br />
is inherently &quot;not fun.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Examples: isn't the difficulty factor in A-6 mostly attributable to 
<br />
the one thing that was mandated by rule to make the event &quot;fun&quot; 
<br />
or &quot;easy&quot;: the paper covering? 
<br />
<br />Paper is heavy, hard to apply when compared to plastic, and it is 
<br />
not dimensionally stable. Given the high weight limit of A-6 and its 
<br />
small size, covering with dry cleaner's plastic bag or similar would 
<br />
have been as light or lighter, easier and cheaper. Covering a
<br />
dihedraled or polyhedraled wing with paper is not that easy. 
<br />
Covering a more complex shape such as a Manhattan fuselage is even 
<br />
more challenging.
<br />
<br />Picture covering an A-6 with with Pennyplane Plastic or PM2L or 
<br />
Polymicro or whatever from 15 years ago. You would be done in 15 
<br />
minutes. Instead, with paper you have to prepare the paper by 
<br />
crumpling and/or shrinking, allow to dry, figure out an adhesive, 
<br />
carefully cut &amp; apply (messy and awkward and hard for beginners 
<br />
fingers), blah. If you are a beginner this is probably more work 
<br />
than building the rest of the model.
<br />
<br />Also, using A-6 as an example: the original rules called for a 1/32&quot; 
<br />
prop shaft. How &quot;easy&quot; is that to form and exactly what thrust 
<br />
bearing might accomodate it? Are we implying that a beginner form a 
<br />
wire thrust bearing and install it? And what about the &quot;easy&quot; flat 
<br />
prop blades with the inset, flush spar called out on every plan?
<br />
<br />I'm not advocating that A-6's should be covered with plastic or that 
<br />
any other changes be made to their rules. I personally enjoyed 
<br />
covering my model with paper. But I am saying that if the goal of a 
<br />
class is to be &quot;easy&quot; for beginners the rules should be consistent 
<br />
in creating an &quot;easy&quot; airplane to build. Not one that is easy up to 
<br />
a point, and then a migraine to complete.
