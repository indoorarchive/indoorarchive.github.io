One of the properties of balsa that a builder looks for and greedily covets
<br />
is high stiffness ratio (modulus of elasticity) balsa for spars on light,
<br />
high duration models; wood that maximizes strength and reduces weight in
<br />
these models. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Several people have studied and published methods to determine higher
<br />
stiffness balsa by testing. The most popular test was developed by Bernard
<br />
Hunt and John Taylor, called the &quot;Stiffness Coefficient&quot; (SC). Modulus of
<br />
Elasticity (a stress-stiffness ratio - &quot;E&quot;) was massaged to provide a ratio
<br />
of stiffness over a range of densities - 4# to 6# for the SC test. The SC
<br />
test was easy to conduct compared to other methods and relied on the Euler
<br />
buckling formula (slender columns) for determining E of beams. For the model
<br />
builder, this would include wing spars and pushing a sheet of balsa into the
<br />
table of an electronic weighing scale, which was an easy task. Joseph
<br />
Maxwell developed a slightly more complicated test and formula based on
<br />
deviation from average E throughout the density range of indoor balsa; thus,
<br />
much more accurate in assessing stiffness than the Hunt-Taylor SC test.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />True-weight Indoor Balsa (TWIB) adopted the Hunt-Taylor SC test to grade its
<br />
balsa. Based on the SC, algorithms put increasing price premiums on the
<br />
volume of a sheet the higher it tests. The algorithms priced volume, also.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />As most who use this testing for finding good spar wood, I followed the easy
<br />
route and established a relationship with Hunt on the several websites that
<br />
offered calculators for the stiffness coefficient test.
<br />
&lt;indoorduration.com&gt;, the parent site of  TWIB, offered a downloadable
<br />
version of the calculator for desktop use. Quite convenient. Then I
<br />
discovered that the downloaded calculator was modified from the original
<br />
published formulas used by Hunt and later posted by Don Slusarczyk, on his
<br />
web site. This was a couple years ago, or more. I questioned Tim Goldstein
<br />
about it at the time and got some response. And, eventually forgot the
<br />
matter; until recently when I used the same calculator, with outrageous test
<br />
results. &quot;Outrageous&quot; means checked wood and pretzels (mush, set, junk) were
<br />
yielding impressive results. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I was pissed, for several reasons. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />With this introduction, the following may make some sense. In responding to
<br />
the post by Tim, I decided to perform some pseudo-scientific testing. I had
<br />
already determined that the Hunt-Taylor test was not so good. The testing
<br />
would force a more disciplined procedure to confirm gut-feel about the test
<br />
in general; and, demonstrate validity of the modified calculator.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In response to the diversion, test and compare the

</em><br />
---snip----
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, take potshots at honesty
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruce,
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Take your medication and rejoin the real world. 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The calculator was flat out non-linear when comparing it's output to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;real world of testing....&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Let's check and see what is &quot;non-linear&quot;, whatever that means, and &quot;real
<br />
world&quot;. But we need to bring in Tim's explanation for the adjustment to the
<br />
Hunt SC calculator, found in the prior post, to Don. It follows:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;What I have found is that for the range of balsa I deal in primarily, 100
</em><br />
is
<br />
about an average value. The adjustment I made was specific to thick sheets.
<br />
My experience over many thousands of sheets of wood is that unlike density,
<br />
stiffness is pretty consistent for a particular block of wood. I base this
<br />
on taking a block and cutting it entirely to the same thickness sheets and
<br />
then testing them. While the density will vary (sometimes considerably) the
<br />
stiffness coefficient for the wood from that block is quite stable. But what
<br />
I noted was that if I cut some .030&quot; sheets from a block and then some .100&quot;
<br />
sheets there was a great disparity in the stiffness even if the density was
<br />
consistent. More interesting was that the by handling and feel was a very
<br />
stiff and &quot;snappy&quot; piece regardless of thickness. My desire was to get the
<br />
scale more linear in regard to varying thickness of wood so that what by all
<br />
real world tests was a great sheet of stock would also have numbers that
<br />
reflected this in regard to using 100 as &quot;normal&quot;.&lt;
<br />
<br />What I understand from this explanation is that the Hunt SC (we'll call this
<br />
&quot;THS&quot; for &quot;The Hunt System&quot;) values don't work correctly with thicknesses
<br />
over .100&quot;. The adjustment was specific to thick sheets. And, presumably
<br />
stuff under .100&quot; would remain the same, since Tim found those averages
<br />
satisfactory. This is because the averages were close to 100 (average) on
<br />
the THS calculator for thinner sheets. *****How a thickness difference would
<br />
affect the calculations is beyond me. Hunt used .125&quot; X .25&quot; test pieces, if
<br />
I recall, to build the SC formula.
<br />
<br />I would tend to agree that the stiffness values are pretty consistent - that
<br />
is, good vs. poor - within a block. Note, &quot;stiffness&quot; is related to modulus
<br />
of elasticity; &quot;stiffness coefficient&quot; is related to the Hunt method. Sheets
<br />
from a block are usually representative of the block, as are strips from a
<br />
sheet. Next. I can roll a 36&quot; long strip of 7lb wood into a coil nearly
<br />
double and it will whip back very close to its original shape. A nice piece
<br />
of wood that was well below 90 (poor) on THS scale. 10 and higher densities
<br />
from good blocks do the same thing. However, I believe THS calculator was
<br />
designed for 4# to 6# lumber. Everything over that density looks worse on
<br />
THS the denser (harder) it gets. 
<br />
<br />Tim made an adjustment to the calculator to better handle thicker sheets.
<br />
I'll call this the Goldstein Adjustment (GA). We know the problem can't be
<br />
in the Euler Formula or the real World would be in a world of hurt. Hunt's
<br />
calculations are suspect.
<br />
<br />To evaluate this adjustment I ran a series of tests of my stuff for a
<br />
comparison of the calculators' output. To paraphrase, I broke some sticks.
<br />
Material ranged from 0.6# (pounds per cubic foot) to 16.2#. I didn't concern
<br />
myself too much with thickness, but everything happened to be about .090&quot;
<br />
and thicker in the first series. The balsa samples were up to .311&quot; wide and
<br />
18&quot; long. These sizes are used to isolate density and grain variations for
<br />
more accurate tests. Tim usually tests material 1.2&quot; up to 2&quot; wide, which in
<br />
my TWIB stock usually includes density bands and grain shifts which will
<br />
distort results. 
<br />
<br />The following results are organized as: Density / THS + GA = % (percent
<br />
difference). THS and GA are the stiffness coefficients for the two
<br />
calculators. Densities are weighted toward the design range of the original
<br />
calculator. All balsa samples exceed the thickness:length ratio of 100.
<br />
Sample thickness for common 18&quot; lengths must remain under .180&quot; to use the
<br />
Euler buckling method for beams. 
<br />
<br />0.6# / 12.05 + 20.8 = 172% (rigid packing foam, just to avoid more
<br />
diversion); 
<br />
<br />3.6# / 109.7 + 135 = 123%; 
<br />
<br />4# / 117 + 152 = 130%; 
<br />
<br />4.9# / 93.8 + 117.2 = 125%
<br />
<br />6.5# / 73.4 + 87.3 = 120%
<br />
<br />10.8# / 63.8 + 76.1 = 119%
<br />
<br />16.2# / 50.46 + 60.1 119%
<br />
<br />A second series of sticks were broken [not really] which included samples
<br />
under .100&quot; thick to check for among other things a closer deviation from
<br />
THS. According to the premise, thinner samples should match or have a
<br />
tighter margin of difference in the comparison of the calculations. Samples
<br />
were about .065&quot; thick. 
<br />
<br />0.88# / 6.72 + 7.63 = 114%; (foam, and E= 386 psi);
<br />
<br />4.1# / 92.23 + 105.1 = 114%; E= 115482 
<br />
<br />4.24# / 109.74 + 126.4 = 115%; E= 146014
<br />
<br />5.22# / 108.3 + 123.3 = 114%; E= 218314
<br />
<br />12.3# / 57.45 + 64.7 = 113%; E= 644414 
<br />
<br />I noted and added the modulus of elasticity for this second series. The foam
<br />
density variation of .6# and .88# represents the hazards of the  weighing
<br />
device getting too close to its lower limit of .01g accuracy. I was going to
<br />
include some TWIB sheets, but I couldn't find enough clean sheets and the
<br />
results were just too depressing. I'll have a white elephant sale soon. [I
<br />
already had it; and frankly, feel like an accomplice to a crime even after
<br />
suffering a heavy investment loss.]
<br />
<br />What do all these numbers mean? The second series results indicate a closer
<br />
margin of difference between the Hunt System and Goldstein Adjustment. The
<br />
adjustment margin is tighter in the thinner samples. And, even though it
<br />
didn't matter in my TWIB stock (some of the depression), marginal values
<br />
were boosted into the costlier levels of the price algorithms used for TWIB
<br />
wood. It was only in the last of my purchases that SC numbers began to match
<br />
the grade marks; and they were based on the GA calculator. Since any reason
<br />
for buying the higher graded wood is for stiffer spars, or vanity, the
<br />
natural inclination is to go for the highest rated, which is what I found
<br />
myself doing. Then I realized I could buy 20+ board feet of what I wanted
<br />
for the same price of a 15-sheet TWIB order, about 2 square inches.
<br />
<br />The quick list:
<br />
<br />1.	The GA (Goldstein Adjustment) has nothing to do with thickness
<br />
variations. Euler doesn't discriminate. This is BS (Blowing Smoke). The
<br />
adjustment has everything to do with pricing, and moving less desirable
<br />
wood. I pointed out this complication before TWIB went public.
<br />
<br />THS + GA = BS; BS = $.
<br />
<br />2.	Tim is open about the adjustment. This is BS. There is no indication
<br />
of the adjustment, until he is confronted about it. This public response
<br />
would make Hyde green with envy. In other words, don't be critical,
<br />
especially in private. 
<br />
3.	The Hunt test has problems. This is NOT BS. My mental image of the
<br />
SC scale is one of a missile intercepting another moving on a parabolic
<br />
curve. The two cross paths at about 5# density. Averages under 4.5# move
<br />
higher on the SC scale as density drops, and visa versa. 
<br />
4.	I have abandoned the Hunt SC test for wood stiffness, not because a
<br />
marketer has corrupted what it represents, but because it has restricted,
<br />
limited value for determining stiffer wood through the density ranges. Using
<br />
and comparing modulus of elasticity, together with the Maxwell method is far
<br />
more representative of basic structural engineering.
<br />
5.	Don't ever trust someone else to determine the stiffness
<br />
(elasticity) of your wood. This is NOT BS. My mistake was very costly in
<br />
money and time.
<br />
<br />There is no need to read the rest.
<br />
<br />-------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;..... more balsa than you have probably ever seen.&lt; 
</em><br />
<br />I'm not SNIPPING, so this fragment remains. It's nothing more than a
<br />
derisive insult to validate Tim's expertise in grading balsa and
<br />
understanding the material, generally. Granted, from photos, his garage has
<br />
more wood than mine. I just have a few hundred sheets and several feet of
<br />
boards from various suppliers going back maybe thirty years. But, not much
<br />
material is older than 8 years from the stump. Also, I've culled a far more
<br />
representative variety of the material than is in both of our garages.
<br />
<br />Just a clarification, the SC test is geometrically more accurate the smaller
<br />
the samples are, so a hundred board feet is meaningless. 
<br />
<br />I won't go into how many hands Tim has for testing, grading sheets as he
<br />
calls it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But as Don points out it is immaterial as long as you use the same
</em><br />
calculator to
<br />
test both pieces. And if you use 2 different calculators then the results
<br />
are not comparable.&lt;
<br />
<br />Duchy, for the comparison. I've pointed out that the &quot;immaterial&quot; is
<br />
actually very &quot;material&quot;. See Quick list, item 1; and the tests.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have no clue what you think is dishonest. Yes I sell balsawood that is
</em><br />
marked for stiffness. With the exception of you none of my other customers
<br />
(who are far more successful fliers I might say) seem to have any
<br />
disagreements with the stiffness grading. I have very openly told anyone
<br />
that is interested that I modified the utility a couple of years ago to more
<br />
closely model real world results. You seem to be the only one that feels the
<br />
initial calculations are some sort of holy grail. If you have a problem with
<br />
my updating the calculator so be it. Enjoy breaking stick and trying to make
<br />
balsa match an incorrect model. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If the hobby you enjoy is breaking balsa sticks and blaming your
</em><br />
performance
<br />
on a tool that I freely gave to the hobby then I say more power to you. In
<br />
the mean time I will continue with my plans to increase my supply of balsa
<br />
tested the way I feel is should be. If you disagree with my methods I don't
<br />
care as many other have very favorable comments about my grading and the
<br />
material I supply.
