Don D, 
<br />
<br />We haven't flown together, and don't know each other besides our respective online presences, but I have noticed a particular trend in your posting here.;  You seem to take every perceived opening to take shots at the indoor fliers and community for making events too hard and claim that what those who are doing to progress and further indoor competition are killing the hobby.
<br />
<br />Do you feel the same about Michael Phelps for example.  I mean after all, almost every time he competes he sets a new world record and makes it harder for people to beat him.  Should we fault him for increasing the level of competitive swimming, or applaud him for his hard work and dedication to competition?
<br />
<br />From my perspective, indoor is not being killed by the so called indoorist experts, but rather by a lack of hard work and dedication by beginning fliers.
<br />
<br />Face it, the reality is that indoor flying of the AMA events is a COMPETITION.  As of 2016 I know of no expert or record holder that has not presented their plans, building tips, and trimming information, to the world via the free flight message boards.  You want to build Coslick's Micro EZB?...search it out online.  I know for a fact that very detailed plans exist to build such a model, and that a very nice model can be built from those plans and directions.  There is no magic, no hocus, no pocus, just the simple following of directions and attention to detail.  If one is wanting to pursue indoor flying and is unable or unwilling to pay attention to detail or follow directions, guess what man....regardless of the event they fly, they won't be around long.
<br />
<br />So perhaps the problem is not that indoor is getting too hard.  Perhaps maybe, just maybe, it is that there are people out there who feel that inherently difficult things should be easy, and criticize those who push the performance envelope, when what they should be doing is getting off their lazy, un-dedicated rear ends, read a plan or two, and follow some directions to build a great model.  I guarantee that the time spent building a model, or several for a particular event, will do much more to serve the interests of beginning indoor fliers than crying about how difficult the models are to build.
<br />
<br />And before the few that criticize the indoor community chastise me for a somewhat arrogant viewpoint (which I fully recognize this might be) keep in mind that every year I introduce indoor flying to people who have never built a thing in their lives, and get them to build very nice, competitive models.  And how do they accomplish that?  With a bit of guidance and carefully following directions and plans.  It isn't nearly as hard as people make it out to be.  Trust me, if my high school students can build competitive indoor planes, any adult flier with half an ounce of skill should be able to do the same or better.
<br />
