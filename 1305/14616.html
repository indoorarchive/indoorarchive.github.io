Interesting site, lots of ceiling obstructions. 
<br />
Once the last ceiling blower was turned off, the air was pretty decent. 
<br />
<br />As the sole F1D flier, it was kind of lonely. {grin} 
<br />
I understand from talking to some of the local guys that no one flies F1D in the Detroit area now. 
<br />
I was using very thin rubber and low launch torque and was easily outclimbing the site, getting into the obstructions. Three prop tucks, one flight where I got hung up, only one decent flight of 21:11. Midaired twice, once with a Manhattan cabin of all things. Model again shrugged off all comers. My model got a lot of attention as most had never seen one fly before and were fascinated.
<br />
<br />Out of the mouths of babes...
<br />
My son and daughter attended and flew their first penny planes. They thought that they would be flying against other kids. I told them no. &quot;You mean we are flying against the adults and the old people?&quot;
<br />
<br />As I helped them get them trimmed, it soon became apparent that they had a lot of potential. Six minute trim flights became seven and eight. They kept swapping who was on top, with my daughter finally getting several epic bounces and landing with 9:44, barely beating his 9:36! She ended up taking 3rd place.
<br />
<br />I think the winning times for 1 and 2 were 10:11 and 10:00. 
<br />
<br />It was interesting watching the strategies for ministick. The ones that won the event went to the top and bounced and bounced and bounces and bounced and bounced some more. Those that tried to keep them cruising below the girders didn't win. Go for broke and pray for luck. An awful lot of balloon recoveries occurred.
<br />
<br />It was pretty well attended. Hope to see more folks next year.
<br />
<br />Regards.
<br />

P.S. A public Thank You to Tom Sova for the use of his balloon.
