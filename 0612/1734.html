<br />Low  ceiling flying with duration models is all about cruise time and using

the  turns efficiently. The longer one can spend climbing to the ceiling the 
<br />
less  time spent bouncing around the ceiling and the longer the flight. Even 
<br />
with VP  props on F1D I use a larger motor cross section in low ceilings than 
<br />
high. The  goal is to use up the turns in the cruise and the larger motor give a 
<br />
little  more rpm in the later part of the flight which should and will 
<br />
increase the  time.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Fred,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The thinner motor will spend more time climbing to the ceiling than the  
<br />
thicker motor.  It has a &quot;flatter&quot; distribution of torque around the cruise  point 
<br />
for a longer cruise without hitting the ceiling.  It permits you to  use more 
<br />
of the torque curve without exceeding the models ability to control  torque 
<br />
roll or hitting the ceiling.  This model clearly will fly  better with a 
<br />
thinner motor.  It is using a 60 foot ceiling motor in a  30 foot room.  It would 
<br />
fly better with a better prop, too, but contest  rules restrict it to 
<br />
inefficient props.  For the given prop type, the best  prop is the one that flies level 
<br />
with the least torque, an easy task.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
We are speaking here in generalities.  Thin and thick are relative  terms.  
<br />
Thinner isn't always better.  There is an optimum size.   My criteria help find 
<br />
that size.  The optimum motor is the one that takes  off from floor level, 
<br />
climbs to and levels off just below the ceiling and  lands with few or no turns 
<br />
left on the motor.  For such to happen, the  cruise torque will be somewhere 
<br />
in the middle of the torque curve, the exact  location depending on the 
<br />
distribution of propeller efficiency during the  flight.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
In short, my rules for selecting motor size and prop pitch:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Prop is selected for minimum torque to fly level.
<br />
Motor cross section is selected to produce that level flight torque at  about 
<br />
mid turns.
<br />
(Motor is wound as close to 100% as you dare)
<br />
Motor weight and length are selected for ceiling height.
<br />
(This can be estimated (1.) from energy required to reach ceiling divided  by 
<br />
average prop efficiency in climb, (2.) extrapolation from trial flight, in  
<br />
which the effect of  the prop is implicit in the data or (3.) trials  with 
<br />
progressively shorter motors. If the motor weight becomes  significantly different 
<br />
from torque test motor, calculate or re fly level flight  torque and 
<br />
recalculate cross section.)
<br />
It is an iterative process.  Starting with a close guess makes for a  short 
<br />
iteration.
