<br />
Bill,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;Are we talking about thrustline or are we talking about AOA of the  wing?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I'm talking about both.  Both affect the performance of the  plane.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;My view on thrustline is that it needs to be in the direction the model is  
<br />
flying.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
That would be ideal, but it is not always possible, because of the relative  
<br />
positions of the aerodynamic force, the CG and the thrustline.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;The only way to adjust the AOA is by shifting the CG.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
No.  That is true in glide.  But in powered flight you have a  third force, 
<br />
thrust (and a torque), and a different balancing of forces  that will move the 
<br />
AOA to accommodate the balance of the three forces.  In  pitch stable glide, 
<br />
the AOA will shift to move the CP to coincide with the  CG.  If the AOA is too 
<br />
high, the CP will be behind the CG and a moment will  rotate the AOA downward 
<br />
toward trim AOA, and vice versa.  Adding  a thrust moment disturbs this 
<br />
balance and requires a different trim AOA to make  it balance.  I am not familiar 
<br />
with the configuration of the LittleSquare,  but most indoor configurations 
<br />
(Pennypland, Ministick) have CG above  thrustline.  That would imply that the 
<br />
thrust produces an up pitch  moment.  To accommodate that the plane would fly at a 
<br />
higher AOA to produce  a countering down moment.  Moving the CG could fix 
<br />
this, but only for one  value of thrust.  Same for changing wing incidence.  That 
<br />
would spoil  it for every other value of thrust.  Changing the location of 
<br />
thrust is  difficult.  The motor hangs below the fuselage stick, not between the 
<br />
&nbsp;wingposts.  Changing the angle of thrust may work; it produces a correction  
<br />
proportional to the disturbance, downthrust to counter the upward  moment.  
<br />
This puts the prop at an angle to the direction of flight, which  produces 
<br />
additional moments from the prop.  As usual, we are seeking  an optimum balance 
<br />
between a number of competing variables.  How do  you find the best combination? 
<br />
&nbsp;Trials.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;Neil - The last motor used was 2g x 17&quot; wound to 2080 turns and .9 in-oz  
<br />
and backed off to 1760 turns and .30 in-oz. You're giving up a lot of potential  
<br />
time if you don't teach them to wind to maximum and back off to an 
<br />
appropriate  launch torque. My models will usually barely maintain cruise if wound to 
<br />
500  turns. I think you've just told us the reason for the short flight times 
<br />
you're  experiencing.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Backing off 10% from maximum (breaking) turns backs off 30% from  available 
<br />
energy and converts 4,000 ft-lb/lb rubber into 2,800 ft-lb/lb  rubber.  Backing 
<br />
off 15% from maximum turns backs off 40% from available  energy, converting 
<br />
4,000 ft-lb/lb rubber into 2,400 ft-lb/lb rubber.   Backing off 20% from 
<br />
maximum turns backs off 45% from available energy,  converting 4,000 ft-lb/lb rubber 
<br />
into 2,200 ft-lb/lb rubber.  I think this  last case approximates what you 
<br />
have described.  You are carrying a lot of  rubber weight and not using its 
<br />
energy potential.  When you back off on  turns, you are sacrificing energy on the 
<br />
highest energy density part of the  torque curve.  If you need less torque, I 
<br />
suggest thinner rubber, which  also permits more turns per inch, and a longer 
<br />
motor for even more turns for the  same weight of rubber.  And wind to at 
<br />
least 95% of breaking turns.   So what if the motors don't last long.  Rubber is 
<br />
fuel.  Burn  it.
<br />
