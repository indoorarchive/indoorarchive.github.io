Hi John,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I enjoy and admire your posts, too.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;You appear to assume that a primary requirement of the motor is that the  
<br />
aeroplane will not touch the ceiling.  Surely the flight is not terminated  if 
<br />
the ceiling is touched.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
This is a matter of personal choice.  I noticed that almost always  when an 
<br />
aeroplane contacts any obstacle, it ends up bouncing off several more  
<br />
obstacles and doing a wall dive, nose down, top of wing against wall.  We  have a lot 
<br />
of obstacles in our gym.  I don't like to think of flight as a  3-D pinball 
<br />
game.  I set for myself the task of developing a method for  finding the motor 
<br />
cross section and length that would get the maximum duration  without touching 
<br />
the ceiling.  If you  have a smooth flat ceiling and  the airplane can circle 
<br />
with the prop tapping the ceiling, go ahead.  You  can fly a 60 foot ceiling 
<br />
motor under a 30 foot ceiling and get a lot more  time.  I don't consider that 
<br />
flying free.  Some of the smaller planes  can be made to circle tightly enough 
<br />
to circle around a light fixture between  the beams, tapping the ceiling with 
<br />
the prop tips.  But there is an air  drift across the ceiling that limits how 
<br />
long your luck will hold out.  I  don't fly competitively.  I fly to explore 
<br />
the scientific principles of  flight.  So my task was limited to flying below 
<br />
a specified height.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;You say that the propeller efficiency is highest at the start of the  flight.
<br />
My propellers are certainly not designed that way.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The important point to understand here is that the propeller efficiency  
<br />
distribution affects the shape of the curve of energy delivered by the  propeller, 
<br />
making it different from the curve of the energy delivered  by the motor.  
<br />
That affects the decision on motor cross section.   Everyone is familiar with 
<br />
torque curves.  Very few have integrated the  torque curve to produce the energy 
<br />
curve.  Very, very few have considered  what the curve of energy delivered by 
<br />
the prop looks like.  Very, very few  have considered the relationship of 
<br />
those curves to the flight trajectory.   I have calculated flight trajectories 
<br />
from such curves and that seems to support  my concept for motor selection.  I 
<br />
tried to start with the familiar and  move toward the unfamiliar.  If the 
<br />
propeller efficiency was constant, the  cruise torque point is at 47% of that 
<br />
particular torque curve, fairly typical  of Tan II.  The 47% will vary with 
<br />
different shapes of torque curve,  but the point always occurs at 25% of the 
<br />
available energy.  Propeller  efficiency alters the shape of the curve and moves that 
<br />
25% energy point.   My experience with one propeller indicates that the shift 
<br />
is to about 54% of  turns, implying the prop efficiency was greater at the 
<br />
higher torque end, at the  beginning of the flight.  Maybe other props will 
<br />
produce a different  result.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;Your statements on backing-off are not to clear but you would appear  to
<br />
assume that the shape of a backedâ€“off torque curve is the same as the  shape
<br />
of part of a non-backed-off torque curve, and that is not so.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
No.  I understand that the backed off curve is a portion of the full  torque 
<br />
curve.  I understand that the rationale of backing off is that you  avoid the 
<br />
torque spike and fly on the &quot;flat&quot; part of the torque curve.   What I do not 
<br />
understand is the tradeoff involved in sacrificing more that half  of the 
<br />
energy available from the motor, while carrying the whole weight.   Maybe I am 
<br />
missing something, but I have never seen any discussion of  this.  What is gained 
<br />
by sacrificing energy?  Is there a tradeoff with  an optimum tradeoff point?  
<br />
Where is it?  How do you find it?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;You have so much to contribute, please slow down a little!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I don't have time to slow down, I'm not going to live very long, already  
<br />
losing my eyesight to diabetes.  And I don't mind making mistakes,  that's how I 
<br />
learn.  By posting on here I get my ideas reviewed.   Often, though, the 
<br />
comments are not very illuminating.
<br />
