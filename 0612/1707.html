&quot;I'll leave all that to anyone else who wants to have a go at it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Bill,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I'll have a go at it myself.  I fly indoor models in a school gym that  has a 
<br />
sloping ceiling with beams and air ducts, but it is within the range  that 
<br />
you mention.  I fly with 2 gram motors.  For the last few  years I have taught 
<br />
kids classes and I fly the kind of models that we use in the  class.  These 
<br />
differ from what you fly, but the principles are the  same.  I have a torque 
<br />
meter and have torque tests going back to  1979.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The ceiling height and torque curve limit the amount of rubber that can be  
<br />
carried by limiting the amount of energy that can be used in the flight  
<br />
trajectory.  The shape of the flight trajectory is directly related to the  shape of 
<br />
the torque curve, mediated by the propeller efficiency.  The best  duration 
<br />
will occur when you use all the energy available under the torque  curve.  
<br />
Otherwise you are carrying motor weight that does not contribute to  and detracts 
<br />
from duration.  The problem of motor design is one of finding  that limiting 
<br />
weight and distributing that weight between length and cross  section.  Cross 
<br />
section is determined by the torque required to fly  level.  That and energy to 
<br />
reach the ceiling determine weight and  motor length.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Assuming the propeller efficiency was constant, the best flight would  occur 
<br />
when the torque to fly level occurred when there was 1/4 of the  motors total 
<br />
energy remaining in the motor.  Under that assumption, 1/4 of  the energy is 
<br />
used in the climb, 1/2 of the energy is used to maintain altitude  during climb 
<br />
and 1/4 is used in the descent.  This is true no matter  what shape the 
<br />
torque curve has.  As an example, a sample of Tan II that I  tested had this point 
<br />
at 47% of breaking turns.  Propeller efficiency is  not constant.  It is 
<br />
highest at the beginning and drops to zero at the end  of the flight.  This biases 
<br />
the cruise torque point toward the high  end.  My airplanes seem to do best 
<br />
when the cruise torque is around 53-55%  of maximum turns.  The exact value 
<br />
depends on the distribution of propeller  efficiency over turns during flight.  It 
<br />
is actually at the 25% point on  the energy delivered by the propeller to the 
<br />
plane curve.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Something in your post caught my eye, but was overlooked in my  response:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;The last motor used was 2g x 17&quot; wound to 2080 turns and .9 in-oz and  
<br />
backed off to 1760 turns and .30 in-oz. You're giving up a lot of potential time  
<br />
if you don't teach them to wind to maximum and back off to an appropriate 
<br />
launch  torque. My models will usually barely maintain cruise if wound to 500  
<br />
turns.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I estimate from the parameters that you gave that 2,080 turns is about  94% 
<br />
of breaking turns.  500 turns is only 23% of breaking turns.   Winding to 54% 
<br />
of breaking turns would produce much more than cruise torque with  this motor.  
<br />
That is another indication that the motor cross section is too  great.  I 
<br />
estimated this motor as 0.084 wide.  The ratio of  torques at 23% and 54% is 0.70 
<br />
and the cross sections vary with the 2/3 power of  torque, so I suggest 
<br />
reducing motor width by 0.79 to 0.066&quot;.  The  length will go up to 21.6&quot; to keep 
<br />
the same weight, but you have been hitting  the ceiling, so you may want to try 
<br />
shortening the motor until it just clears  the ceiling.  Or try a half motor 
<br />
and extrapolate from the maximum height  it gives.
<br />
