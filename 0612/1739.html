I have been interested in the discussion about SO rules. Technology Students Association (TSA) flight endurance event rules currently take three pages in the rule book. The models are similar to SO models except for use of a smaller commercial prop, one gram motors and an ROG requirement. The event is sterile and all the models flown are virtually the same year after year. I have mentored for eight years with seven state champions as a result. I thought that the current rules stifled students' creativity. I have proposed the following rules that will prepare students for the real world of creativity and innovation. So far the rules committee has ignored my proposal. I would be courious as to what this group thinks about wide open rules such a these.

<br />
<br /><br />FLIGHT ENDURANCE
<br />
<br />OVERVIEW
<br />
<br />Participants analyze fl ight principles with a rubber band powered
<br />
<br />model aircraft.
<br />
<br />PURPOSE
<br />
<br />Build, fl y, and adjust (trim) a model to make long endurance fl ights
<br />
<br />inside a contained airspace. Any model design is acceptable if the
<br />
<br />model complies with the event specifi cations. All models are to be
<br />
<br />built and test fl own before the event date.
<br />
<br />ELIGIBILITY
<br />
<br />Entries are limited to two (2) individuals per chapter.
<br />
<br />TIME LIMITS
<br />
<br />A. Entries must be started and completed during the current school
<br />
<br />year.
<br />
<br />B. Participants are provided a minimum of thirty (30) minutes for
<br />
<br />trim fl ights at the event site.
<br />
<br />ATTIRE
<br />
<br />Business Casual dress as described in Competitive Events Attire is
<br />
<br />the minimum requirement.
<br />
<br />PROCEDURE
<br />
<br />A. Participants report to the event coordinator at the time and place
<br />
<br />stated in the conference program.
<br />
<br />B. Participants then proceed to the fl ying site for trim fl ying. Models
<br />
<br />are evaluated for specifi cation compliance during the trim session.
<br />
<br />Time allotted for the trim portion may be extended according to
<br />
<br />the number of participants and site scheduling.
<br />
<br />C. Participants have two (2) opportunities to fl y their models for
<br />
<br />offi cial times. The times posted during the time trials are used to
<br />
<br />determine the sixteen (16) top combined times.
<br />
<br />D. Participants attend a pilot’s meeting to review the sequence for ������������������������������ �
<br />
<br />making the offi cial fl ights.
<br />
<br />E. In an orderly fashion, participants wind their models and proceed
<br />
<br />to a group timer for permission to fl y.
<br />
<br />F. Participants place their models on the fl oor and wait for the signal
<br />
<br />to release from the timer. Timing begins when the model rises off
<br />
<br />the ground.
<br />
<br />G. Flight time ends when models hit the fl oor/ground or when they
<br />
<br />come to rest on an obstruction.
<br />
<br />H. No repairs are allowed after time trials begin.
<br />
<br />I. Each participant has the times of two (2) offi cial fl ights recorded
<br />
<br />by the timer.
<br />
<br />J. Following the second fl ight, the sixteen (16) top combined
<br />
<br />times’ models are placed on their notebooks for the next step in
<br />
<br />evaluation.
<br />
<br />K. Notebooks and boxes of the sixteen (16) fi nalists are reviewed
<br />
<br />for discrepancies or infractions.
<br />
<br />L. Ties are broken by determining the longest single fl ight time.
<br />
<br />REGULATIONS
<br />
<br />A. All documentation must be computer-generated on 8½&quot; x 11&quot;
<br />
<br />paper and contained in a notebook [a standard three (3)-ring
<br />
<br />binder]. Each notebook must include a fl ight log (see offi cial
<br />
<br />sample that follows) with the previous ten (10) fl ights signed
<br />
<br />off by the participant’s advisor and a written report organized to
<br />
<br />explain these specifi c points:
<br />
<br />1. The technical attributes of the design and a description and
<br />
<br />identifi cation of parts
<br />
<br />2. The modifi cations and an explanation of why each was
<br />
<br />developed
<br />
<br />3. A technical review of the fl ight log that explains the trim
<br />
<br />adjustments and modifi cations required to improve endurance.
<br />
<br />Experts from the Academy of Model Aeronautics (AMA)
<br />
<br />and the National Free Flight Society (NFFS) may scrutinize
<br />
<br />this information for validity.

<br />������������������������������ �
<br />
<br />B. The aircraft and its parts must be contained in a flfl ight box that
<br />
<br />does not exceed 25cm x 40cm x 60cm.
<br />
<br />C. Materials include the following:
<br />
<br />1. Models are to be made of wood and tissue paper for fuselage
<br />
<br />and fl ying surfaces (wings, fi n and stabilizer). No plastic
<br />
<br />foams, fi lms, or condenser paper are allowed.
<br />
<br />2. Models use a commercially available plastic propeller or
<br />
<br />propeller assembly: minimum of 140mm to a maximum of
<br />
<br />170mm in diameter. Trimming or thinning propellers is allowed
<br />
<br />to achieve balance and/or to reduce weight.
<br />
<br />3. Fuselage dimension: minimum of 300mm in length measured
<br />
<br />with prop assembly attached.
<br />
<br />4. Wingspan: maximum of 50cm horizontally projected, wing
<br />
<br />chord 12cm projected.
<br />
<br />5. Rubber motor: maximum weight of motor is one (1) gram,
<br />
<br />including the 0-ring. No length measurement is made. Spare
<br />
<br />motors are allowed during the offi cial fl ights. One rubber 0-ring

<br />The fl ight box
<br />
<br />is required and is
<br />
<br />intended to protect the
<br />
<br />plane in transit.
<br />
<br />may be used on the rubber motor loop at the motor hook end ������������������������������ �
<br />
<br />for easier handling of wound motors.
<br />
<br />6. Model weight: minimum of 7 grams, maximum of 21 grams.
<br />
<br />Models are weighed without motors attached. Clay is permitted
<br />
<br />for trim ballast. (Model is weighed with clay ballast.)
<br />
<br />7. Steel wire may be used only for propeller shaft, motor hook,
<br />
<br />and landing gear.
<br />
<br />8. The two wheels must be a minimum of 15mm in diameter of
<br />
<br />plastic or wood and they must roll.
<br />
<br />D. Acceptable fl ight support equipment includes the following:
<br />
<br />1. Mechanical rubber motor winders (Electricity may not be
<br />
<br />available at every site.)
<br />
<br />2. A winding stooge may be used to anchor the model while its
<br />
<br />motor is being wound.
<br />
<br />E. The landing gear must support the airplane without sagging in its
<br />
<br />rested position.
<br />
<br />EVALUATION
<br />
<br />Evaluation is based on the duration of fl ight, written report, fl ight log
<br />
<br />and fl ight box. A bonus of ten (10) seconds is added to the fl ight time
<br />
<br />per fl ight if the airplane successfully lands on its wheels and comes
<br />
<br />to a rest on its wheels.
