Piednoir Can-Formed Helical Propeller Blades
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Gary Hinze, May 2005
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
(Note: * is multiplication, ^ is exponentiation.)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Model airplane propeller blades made of thin sheets of wood may be twisted  
<br />
by soaking them in water and binding them to the side of a cylindrical can, 
<br />
with  the blade radius aligned with a line offset a small angle from a vertical 
<br />
line  on the side of the can.  This produces a blade twist angle that is 
<br />
linearly  related to the distance along the radius.  This differs from the ideal  
<br />
helical prop angle distribution, which lies along a tangent curve.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
It is also possible to soak a rectangular sheet of balsa in water,   twist 
<br />
the ends and let it dry. This also produces a twist angle that is linearly  
<br />
related to the distance along the radius. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Both of these methods have a linear distribution of blade angle along the  
<br />
radius. Either method can produce the same distribution of blade angle plotted  
<br />
against blade radius. Neither will produce a helical pitch, although various  
<br />
approximations are possible.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Imagine you have a can of radius r and you cut it along a baseline parallel  
<br />
with the axis, unroll it and flatten it out. Now draw an offset line at angle 
<br />
T  (theta) to the baseline and mark off a blade radius length R along the 
<br />
offset  line from the point where it intersects the baseline. Drop a
<br />
perpendicular  from the end of this radius line to the baseline. That 
<br />
perpendicular has length  
<br />
a = R*sin(T). The point where the baseline intersects the offset line is at  
<br />
the axis of the propeller and the point R up the offset line is the blade tip. 
<br />
&nbsp;Now roll the sheet back into the can. A tangent to the can at the tip 
<br />
intersects  a projected can diameter passing through the tip end of the baseline at 
<br />
a tip  blade angle A (alpha). The two radii passing through the blade tip and 
<br />
the  baseline tip form an angle C. The angle C is also the total blade twist 
<br />
from the  axis to the tip. At the propeller axis the blade angle is 90 degrees 
<br />
and the  twist is zero degrees. Note that A+C = 90 degrees. The dropped 
<br />
perpendicular  wrapped on the can is now an arc with angle C at its center. The 
<br />
length of the  arc is related to the can radius and central angle by a = 
<br />
2*pi*r*C/360 (for  angles in degrees). We may now set the two equations for arc length 
<br />
a equal and  find that R*sin(T) = 2*pi*r*C/360.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
This immediately tells us two things. The equation for the offset angle  
<br />
needed when you have the blade radius, the total twist and the can radius is T =  
<br />
arcsin(2*pi*r*C/360*R). It also tells us that the rate of twist along the 
<br />
radius  is uniform, because C = R*sin(T)*360/2*pi*r. This is valid for any 
<br />
fraction of  R, so you can see the twist is linearly related to radius, since the 
<br />
other terms  in this equation form a constant for any given can radius and offset 
<br />
angle. The  rate of change of blade angle with radius is C/R =  
<br />
sin(T)*360/2*pi*r.   A plot of blade angle against radius will be a  straight line. This 
<br />
will not be a helically pitched prop. The plot of blade  angle against radius 
<br />
for a helically pitched prop is an arctangent curve. Also,  if you take a 
<br />
rectangular piece of sheet balsa by the ends and twist it, you  will get a uniform 
<br />
rate of twist. This means the two methods of forming prop  blades can produce 
<br />
the same distribution of twist. The can formed blade radius  will be shortened 
<br />
slightly because it lies along a curved helix. You can get it  exactly thesame 
<br />
by lengthening the radius of the layout line.  Note that  the radius of the 
<br />
can formed prop blade should angle forward from the plane of  rotation at the 
<br />
prop hub.  This is not the way they are usually  constructed.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Since the can formed blade does not have a constant pitch, a choice must be  
<br />
made regarding what blade radius or radii will be used to set the pitch of the 
<br />
&nbsp;propeller.  This will be illustrated in an example, below.Jean-Marie  
<br />
Piednoir developed a method of calculating a curved offset line that produces a  
<br />
helical prop. The straight offset line imposes a constant twist rate on the  
<br />
blade, but the curved line allows a varying twist rate as required by a true  
<br />
helical prop. This was described on an Internet site which is no longer  
<br />
available.  There was a computer program, but no explanation of the theory.  I 
<br />
developed an algorithm that is a little different, because I started with a  slightly 
<br />
different set of assumptions. This note explains the theory and method  of 
<br />
constructing an offset curve and gives examples of such a calculation based  on 
<br />
the dimensions of a George Perryman prop and a Pennyplane prop.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The twist C of a can formed prop blade is linearly related to the angle T  
<br />
(theta) of the offset line at radius R from the axle according to the equation C 
<br />
&nbsp;= R*sin(T)*360/2*pi*r where C is the twist angle and r is the radius of the 
<br />
can.  The rate of twist is dC/dR = sin(T)*360/2*pi*r which is constant for 
<br />
fixed  radius and offset line angle. Since the twist angle C is the complement of 
<br />
the  blade angle A, A+C = 90 degrees, the rate of change of the blade angle 
<br />
is the  opposite of the rate of change of the twist angle.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;We want a curve that makes a different angle T at each radius R such  that 
<br />
the rate of twist corresponds to the rate of twist of a helical prop blade.  
<br />
The blade angle for a helical prop is given by A = arctan(P/2*pi*R) where P is  
<br />
the constant pitch of the prop. When the offset angle T is small, the values 
<br />
of  R along the radius perpendicular to the prop axis and R along the curve are 
<br />
&nbsp;close.  Since A and C are complementary angles, the tangents are reciprocal  
<br />
and therefore C = arctan(2*pi*R/P). We also see that the change, da,  in  
<br />
perpendicular offset from the baseline to the offset line per change in radius,  
<br />
dR,  is da = dR*sin(T) = dR*2*pi*r*C/360*R.  Substituting  arctan(2*pi*R/P) 
<br />
for C gives us da = dR*2*pi*r*arctan(2*pi*R/P)/360*R. If we  define the 
<br />
distances along the baseline as x, we get dx = SQRT(dR^2-da^2). (We  can also use dx = 
<br />
dR*cos(arcsin(2*pi*r*arctan(2*pi*R/P)/360*R)) to calculate dx,  but the other 
<br />
is simpler to calculate and gives identical results.) These  differential 
<br />
equations could perhaps be integrated to give an exact equation for  the offset 
<br />
curve, but I chose an approximate calculation method.  I stepped  along the 
<br />
offset radius curve in fixed small increments of the radius, DR,  calculating the 
<br />
a increment, Da, and x increment, Dx, accumulating each to get  successive 
<br />
values of a and x as I went along to the tip, as shown in the  following 
<br />
examples.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
A George Perryman Propeller
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
“The drawing for the Great Speckled Bird that was in the 1992 NFFS Sympo  
<br />
shows prop blades about 10 inches long and says that they are formed on a 6 inch  
<br />
diameter form at an angle of 15 degrees which gives about 45 degrees total  
<br />
twist.  The prop is supposed to be 26 inches diam by 28 inches  pitch.”  From 
<br />
an Internet discussion.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
This reports the method of setting the can formed blade to achieve  
<br />
approximately the desired helical P/D with the example of a prop attributed to  George 
<br />
Perryman.  Later, the coordinates of a Piednoir curve are calculated  to lay 
<br />
out a curved blade radius producing an exact helical pitch.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The propeller has a diameter of 26&quot; and a pitch of 28&quot;. The blade has a  
<br />
length of 10&quot;, extending from a radius of 3&quot; to the tip at 13&quot;. The nominal P/D  
<br />
is 28/26 = 1.077. For a helical prop, the blade angle at the tip would be  
<br />
arctan(28/26*pi) = 18.92 degrees. The blade angle at the root would be  
<br />
arctan(28/6*pi) = 56.05 degrees. The difference in these angles is 37.13  degrees, not 
<br />
45 degrees. This is the total twist along the 10&quot; length of the  blade. The 
<br />
blade twists at a uniform rate of 3.713 degrees per inch. The  required offset 
<br />
angle for a 6&quot; diameter can is arcsin(2*pi*3*37.13/360*10) =  11.21 degrees. 
<br />
(Note this is not the 15 degrees stated in the original  description. More on 
<br />
that later.) This blade may be set so that both ends have  blade angles as stated 
<br />
above, corresponding to a pitch of 28&quot; at both the root  and tip of the 
<br />
blade. From the uniform rate of twist, the blade angle at each 1&quot;  station along 
<br />
the blade may be calculated, as well as the local pitch and P/D. I  find that 
<br />
the pitch has a maximum value of 38.56 at 8&quot; radius and a P/D of 1.48.  The 
<br />
average pitch is 34.43&quot;, corresponding to an average P/D of 1.32. This is  not the 
<br />
prop we thought we were going to get.  Rather than setting this  prop at the 
<br />
tips, let's set it to match a helical blade angle at the 70% radius,  9.1&quot;. 
<br />
The required blade angle is arctan(28/18.2*pi) = 26.09 degrees. Again,  from the 
<br />
uniform twist rate, we can calculate the blade angles, local pitches  and 
<br />
P/D's for each 1&quot; station along the blade radius. The blade angle at the tip  is 
<br />
11.61 degrees, with a pitch of 16.78&quot; and P/D of 0.645. The root blade angle  
<br />
is 48.71 degrees with a pitch of 21.46 and P/D of 0.826. The highest pitch is  
<br />
29.52&quot; at 7&quot; radius and the P/D is 1.135. The average pitch is 25.24&quot; for an  
<br />
average P/D of 0.971, about 10.9% low. Note that there are two points along 
<br />
the  radius where pitch is 28&quot;. The can formed blade angle line crosses the 
<br />
helical  blade angle curve in two points.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
It is possible that another set point will produce a closer average pitch  
<br />
and nominal P/D.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I tried calculating a blade formed at a 15 degree offset angle on a 6&quot;  
<br />
diameter can and found that it is not possible to set it so the root and tip  blade 
<br />
angles match any helical prop. The blade will have 49.43 degrees of twist  
<br />
from root to tip, at a uniform rate of 4.943 degrees per inch. There is too much 
<br />
&nbsp;twist on this blade to fit any helical curve between the root and tip  radii.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The blade formed at a 15 degree offset angle may be set to match the  helical 
<br />
blade angle at 70% radius. Again, the 28/26 P/D helical blade has a  blade 
<br />
angle of 26.09 degrees at a 9.1&quot; radius. The uniform rate of twist allows  
<br />
calculation of blade angle, pitch and P/D, as before. The blade angle at the  root 
<br />
is 56.24 degrees, the pitch is 28.20 and the P/D is 1.085. The blade angle  at 
<br />
the tip is 6.81 degrees, the pitch is 9.75 &quot; and the P/D is 0.375. The  
<br />
maximum pitch was 33.25&quot; at 6&quot; radius, with P/D of 1.279. The average pitch is  
<br />
26.23&quot; for an average P/D of 1.009.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Although it may be possible, with judicious selection of can radius, offset  
<br />
angle and set points, to closely approximate a desired average pitch, there 
<br />
are  significant departures from the desired P/D, pitch and blade angles. What 
<br />
do  these significant variations do to the efficiency of the prop?  It seems  
<br />
that much of the prop will not be operating at an efficient blade angle.   
<br />
There is a way to vary the rate of twist to more closely approximate the blade  
<br />
angle curve for a helical prop.  It utilizes an offset curve with a varying  
<br />
angle to the baseline.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The coordinates of the Piednoir curve for this prop, 26&quot; diameter, 28&quot;  
<br />
pitch, formed on a 6&quot; diameter can, were calculated.  Using DR = (1)  simplifies 
<br />
the calculations.  The numbers are calculated from Da = (1)*  
<br />
2*pi*r*arctan(2*pi*R/P)/360*R and Dx = SQRT(1-Da^2). The values of a and x are  the cumulative 
<br />
sums of Da and Dx.  R is the distance along the radius  curve, x is the 
<br />
distance along the baseline and a is the perpendicular offset  from the baseline to 
<br />
the radius curve.

Note that the straight line connecting the end points of this curve,  plotted

flat, has a length of 12.87&quot;, about 1% short of the intended 13&quot; blade  
<br />
radius.  The swept diameter will not be the full 26&quot;. The angle between the  
<br />
baseline and the line connecting the endpoints is 27.11 degrees, the angle which  
<br />
the radius curve chord should make to the plane of rotation at the hub.

<br />
Piednoir Curve for a Pennyplane Propeller.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I calculated the x and a coordinates of the Piednoir curve for laying out a  
<br />
helical prop of 12&quot; diameter and P/D = 1.9 on a 4&quot; diameter can. I used 1/4&quot;  
<br />
increments along the curve and calculated the angle of the curve at the  
<br />
midpoints of each increment to improve the accuracy of the calculation. The

<br />
The 45 degree blade angle occurs at 3.63&quot; radius.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
This produces a curve which departs only 0.2&quot; from a straight line drawn  
<br />
with an offset angle of 27.32 degrees. It might seem that there would be little  
<br />
difference between a blade laid out on this curve and one laid out along a 
<br />
27.32  degree straight line. That is not correct, because a 0.2&quot; difference on a 
<br />
2&quot;  radius can makes an angular difference of 5.73 degrees, enough to push an  
<br />
efficient blade attack angle close to a stall. The difference is even more  
<br />
important for lower P/D props because there is an even greater difference in  
<br />
blade angle along their radius.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
This produces a curve which has a 5.98&quot; chord plotted flat and 5.89&quot; when  on 
<br />
the can.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
To use this curve to form a prop, plot x and a on a piece of paper with x  
<br />
going to the right and a going up. This makes a right handed prop. Plot the prop 
<br />
&nbsp;chords parallel with the a axis, centered on the curve. Connect the dots to 
<br />
form  the perimeter of the blade. The leading edge is the top curve. Use this 
<br />
shape to  make a cardboard template for cutting out blades. The blades are 
<br />
made from 1/32&quot;  sheet balsa. Orient the x axis parallel with the grain. Mark the 
<br />
45 degree chord  on both sides of each blade. Make as many paper patterns as 
<br />
you want blades.  Wrap the paper patterns around the can(s) with the x axis 
<br />
parallel with the  centerline of the can and the a axis circumferential. You may 
<br />
want to cover the  patterns with plastic film to protect them from the we 
<br />
tblade.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The blades on a 12&quot; prop are typically 5&quot; long with an inch of balsa dowel  
<br />
projecting inward from the root. The dowel is a tight friction fit in a paper,  
<br />
plastic or aluminum tube hub. It will be necessary to place the dowel from 
<br />
the  prop center point at an angle of 27.32 degrees to the chord of the radius 
<br />
curve  and projecting about an inch into the blade. A slot is cut in the blade 
<br />
for the  dowel to fit inside. The slot should be incorporated into the 
<br />
cardboard blade  pattern. When the dowels are fit into the tube hub, the chords 
<br />
marked at the 45  degree radii can be used to set the angles of the blades in the 
<br />
hub. Set the  marked chords so they make a right angle with each other and the 
<br />
prop shaft  bisects one of the right angles. You can judge this very closely 
<br />
by eye.   You also can lightly strap bits of 1/16&quot; square balsa to the blades 
<br />
