<br />
&nbsp;Sorry that I previously sent the current rules. Here is my new rules proposal. I would
<br />
welcome any feedback.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />OVERVIEW
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Participants construct free flying, unguided,  indoor model airplanes powered by a rubber
<br />
motor to learn principles of flight, interpretation of construction drawings, construction
<br />
of light structures,  use of specialized construction materials, and efficient utilization
<br />
of a variable power source.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />ELIGIBILITY
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Entries are limited to two (2) individuals per chapter.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />TIME LIMIT OF EVENT
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Participants will have a three hour window to produce a maximum of three officially timed
<br />
flights for record. More than one model may be flying at the same time if the site is
<br />
large enough to provide adequate airspace.  Test flying may take place at any time during
<br />
the three hour window at judge's discretion. Airspace priority will be given to official
<br />
flights. More than one model may be test flown,  but only one model may be flown for
<br />
officially timed flights.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />PROCEDURE
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />A. Participants will present model for judging during the first hour of the event,
<br />
assembled or disassembled inside the transit box. All parts of the model used in timed
<br />
flight must be contained in the box. The outside dimensions of the box will be measured by
<br />
the judges. If the box complies with regulation size, the box will be stamped by the
<br />
judges and the model components contained therein will be marked with a colored marker for
<br />
identification. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />B. Participants will move to an assembly area at the periphery of the site to assemble
<br />
their models. Test flying or official flying may not begin by participants until box and
<br />
model components have been marked.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />C. Participants may fly for record at any time by notifying the chief timer, and, upon the
<br />
timer's signal, will launch the model for timed flight.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />D. Timing will begin when the model leaves the participant's hand and will stop when the
<br />
model comes to rest on the floor or comes to rest permanently (5 seconds) on any
<br />
obstruction in the flying site. Landing gear, wheels, or skids may be used but are not
<br />
required. A minimum of two timers will time official flights. Times will be rounded back
<br />
to the nearest second. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />E. Each participant may fly three official flights, the best two being added together for
<br />
score in total seconds of flight time. Repairs to models may be made at any time.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />F.  At the end of the three hour window, participants will place their models and model
<br />
boxes in the assembly area for final judging. Judges will place the models in side by side
<br />
order of their charisma, first on the left to last on the right. The model with the
<br />
highest charisma in the opinion of the judges, will have the flight score multiplied by a
<br />
charisma factor of 1.50. Charisma factor of the remaining models will be scored from 1.40
<br />
to 1.00, based solely on the opinion of the judges. Judge's opinion will be subjective and
<br />
final. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />G. Placing of the participants will be scored on total flight time in seconds multiplied
<br />
by the assigned charisma factor. Highest score wins. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />REGULATIONS    
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />A. Exterior dimensions of the transit box may not exceed 50cm X 30cm X 25cm to include the
<br />
lid. Model components must be fully enclosed in the six-sided box.  
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />B. There will be no restrictions on the model size, weight, propeller(s), rubber size or
<br />
weight, or design. Model must be constructed from balsa and paper. No plastic coverings or
<br />
condenser paper will be allowed. Model may use any propeller commercially available or one
<br />
constructed of any other material by the participant. Steel wire may be used for propeller
<br />
shaft, rear rubber hook, and landing gear (if installed.) Clay may be used for ballasting.
<br />
The only other restriction is that the model, or model components (if the model
<br />
disassembles),  must be transported for initial checkin  inside the transit box.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />EVALUATION AND CHARISMA FACTOR
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />A. Charisma factor will be subjective based on the following criteria:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. General Appeal: Does it look good in the air?  Is it colorful?  Is it an original
<br />
design or a kit model?  Is the design unusual but functional?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Workmanship:  Is the model neat and sharp looking compared to others?  Are the
<br />
surfaces warped or true?  Has the covering been applied neatly. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Design:  Is it unusual but functional?  Is it multiwinged?  Is it a tractor or
<br />
pusher?  Are there multiple motors? Does it look like a real airplane?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />That's it...short and sweet and easy to judge. Just measure the box, mark the parts and
<br />
box with a distinctive mark, time the flights, multiply the time by the charisma factor
<br />
and, voila!, the contest is complete. No weighing of models (to be competitive, models
<br />
weighing more than 20 grams will not be capable of flying in most indoor sites),  no
<br />
weighing of rubber, no measurement of models, no reports, no books, no signoffs by
<br />
supervisors, nada. These kids won't need to keep data to get the models to fly, only keep
<br />
data to fly very well. The scientifically-oriented kids will keep data, experiment with
<br />
rubber sizes and props, thrust offsets, stabilizer and wing incidence, balance points, and
<br />
motor torque to get the best duration from the design chosen. They will have an advantage
<br />
on the non-data-keeping kids,  just as it will be in a real job, only the difference then
<br />
will be income earned. Might as well teach them that principle now. Don't worry about
<br />
limiting rubber motor weights. Models don't necessarily fly longer with heavier motors.
<br />
Sometimes just the opposite is true. The rubber motor and propeller combination is what is
<br />
important. Too much rubber is like using a dragster motor in a volkswagen. Too little
<br />
rubber and the lack of torque is like using a volkswagen engine in a semi-trailer truck.
<br />
Let the participants find this out on their own. This makes a good experiment. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Now for the kids and what they learn:  The rules simulate the parameters given to any
<br />
engineering design team...get the most out of the least.  The Mars rovers were designed to
<br />
fit into a cargo compartment on the end of a rocket. The weight had to be minimized, the
<br />
components and devices maximized, and the device had to work when it got there. That was
<br />
it!  Few rules and maximum result. The design team had very few other restrictions (well,
<br />
budget for them was important too), but that was it. Many designs were tried and tested.
<br />
The best one got built and flown to Mars,  AND IT IS WORKING even better than expected and
<br />
the mission has been extended 3 months. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Science should be about experimenting to find the best combinations and designs. Let's not
<br />
handcuff ingenuity with a bunch of superfluous rules until all the models flown look the
<br />
same. Give the kids a chance to experiment and fail as well as succeed. All of the
<br />
information they need to be successful in this event is on the internet (if they have the
<br />
ambition, curiosity and drive to go find it.)  That's part of science: find out what
<br />
other's have found out, use the good stuff, add your own stuff, and discard the stuff that
<br />
won't make the project better.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Now to the charisma factor: This is a reward device for making intelligent choices. If the
<br />
participant chooses a design that looks like a real airplane,or a model with multimotors,
<br />
etc., the model will, necessarily, not fly as long as a lightweight pure duration model.
<br />
The difference in flight time could be extreme. The highest duration will come from
<br />
choosing a lightweight design with a long motorstick and tailboom, wing mounted up on
<br />
pylons above the motorstick, and with a home-made, built-up prop made with blades made
<br />
from a Dixie cup or from balsa molded on a form then attached to a propspar. A light wing
<br />
loading is mandantory for long flights. Again, all this information is out there on the
<br />
internet or available from mentors. The charisma factor for the unusual, original model
<br />
may be up to 1.50. The charisma factor for a minimum structure, all out duration model
<br />
could be as low as 1.00 in the judges' opinion. Thus, the participant who chooses to go
<br />
with a realistic, or unusual design airplane may get their time boosted by 50%. The all
<br />
out duration design with a low charisma factor must gain points by duration and not rely
<br />
on charisma. THE CHOICE IS UP TO THE PARTICIPANT, just as it would be on an engineering
<br />
design team. Risk and reward...let's teach it now rather than having the shock hit the
<br />
student when he has his future on the line in an engineering job.  
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Through the use of the charisma factor, the playing field would be leveled. The student
<br />
would have choices to make. Champions make good choices. The end result is a much more
<br />
exciting project, a chance for the student to design and fly an original, realistic model
<br />
to WOW the spectators, fellow students, and get rewarded by the judges for the effort. Or,
<br />
the student may opt  to fly a bare bones model  to only impress the spectators and
<br />
competitors with some  long duration flights of several minutes but take a hit on the
<br />
charisma multiplier. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I am disappointed at  seeing hand-me-down airplanes being flown year after year by some
<br />
schools. The new rules would encourage innovation, ingenuity and experimentation. I
<br />
suggest that this event needs some re-thinking and the suggestions outlined above is what
<br />
is needed.
