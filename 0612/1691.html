Interesting information Gary I have not yet had the time to more than scan through it but I plan to. You should add some drawings and charts and submit it to INAV they are always looking for stuff to put in the newsletter.
<br />
<br />I think I will stay with making prop blocks to form or build my props on as it is probably easier than most people think to make a block.

<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Piednoir Can-Formed Helical Propeller Blades
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Gary Hinze, May 2005
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;(Note: * is multiplication, ^ is exponentiation.)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Model airplane propeller blades made of thin sheets of wood may be twisted 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;by soaking them in water and binding them to the side of a cylindrical can, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;with the blade radius aligned with a line offset a small angle from a vertical 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;line on the side of the can. This produces a blade twist angle that is 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;linearly related to the distance along the radius. This differs from the ideal 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;helical prop angle distribution, which lies along a tangent curve.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also possible to soak a rectangular sheet of balsa in water, twist 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the ends and let it dry. This also produces a twist angle that is linearly 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;related to the distance along the radius. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of these methods have a linear distribution of blade angle along the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;radius. Either method can produce the same distribution of blade angle plotted 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;against blade radius. Neither will produce a helical pitch, although various 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;approximations are possible.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine you have a can of radius r and you cut it along a baseline parallel 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;with the axis, unroll it and flatten it out. Now draw an offset line at angle 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;T (theta) to the baseline and mark off a blade radius length R along the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;offset line from the point where it intersects the baseline. Drop a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;perpendicular from the end of this radius line to the baseline. That 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;perpendicular has length 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a = R*sin(T). The point where the baseline intersects the offset line is at 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the axis of the propeller and the point R up the offset line is the blade tip. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now roll the sheet back into the can. A tangent to the can at the tip 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;intersects a projected can diameter passing through the tip end of the baseline at 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a tip blade angle A (alpha). The two radii passing through the blade tip and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the baseline tip form an angle C. The angle C is also the total blade twist 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;from the axis to the tip. At the propeller axis the blade angle is 90 degrees 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and the twist is zero degrees. Note that A+C = 90 degrees. The dropped 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;perpendicular wrapped on the can is now an arc with angle C at its center. The 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;length of the arc is related to the can radius and central angle by a = 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2*pi*r*C/360 (for angles in degrees). We may now set the two equations for arc length 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a equal and find that R*sin(T) = 2*pi*r*C/360.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This immediately tells us two things. The equation for the offset angle 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;needed when you have the blade radius, the total twist and the can radius is T = 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;arcsin(2*pi*r*C/360*R). It also tells us that the rate of twist along the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;radius is uniform, because C = R*sin(T)*360/2*pi*r. This is valid for any 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;fraction of R, so you can see the twist is linearly related to radius, since the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;other terms in this equation form a constant for any given can radius and offset 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;angle. The rate of change of blade angle with radius is C/R = 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;sin(T)*360/2*pi*r. A plot of blade angle against radius will be a straight line. This 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;will not be a helically pitched prop. The plot of blade angle against radius 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;for a helically pitched prop is an arctangent curve. Also, if you take a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;rectangular piece of sheet balsa by the ends and twist it, you will get a uniform 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;rate of twist. This means the two methods of forming prop blades can produce 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the same distribution of twist. The can formed blade radius will be shortened 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;slightly because it lies along a curved helix. You can get it exactly thesame 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;by lengthening the radius of the layout line. Note that the radius of the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;can formed prop blade should angle forward from the plane of rotation at the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;prop hub. This is not the way they are usually constructed.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the can formed blade does not have a constant pitch, a choice must be 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;made regarding what blade radius or radii will be used to set the pitch of the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;propeller. This will be illustrated in an example, below.Jean-Marie 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Piednoir developed a method of calculating a curved offset line that produces a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;helical prop. The straight offset line imposes a constant twist rate on the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;blade, but the curved line allows a varying twist rate as required by a true 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;helical prop. This was described on an Internet site which is no longer 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;available. There was a computer program, but no explanation of the theory. I 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;developed an algorithm that is a little different, because I started with a slightly 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;different set of assumptions. This note explains the theory and method of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;constructing an offset curve and gives examples of such a calculation based on 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the dimensions of a George Perryman prop and a Pennyplane prop.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The twist C of a can formed prop blade is linearly related to the angle T 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(theta) of the offset line at radius R from the axle according to the equation C 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;= R*sin(T)*360/2*pi*r where C is the twist angle and r is the radius of the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;can. The rate of twist is dC/dR = sin(T)*360/2*pi*r which is constant for 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;fixed radius and offset line angle. Since the twist angle C is the complement of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the blade angle A, A+C = 90 degrees, the rate of change of the blade angle 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is the opposite of the rate of change of the twist angle.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;We want a curve that makes a different angle T at each radius R such that 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the rate of twist corresponds to the rate of twist of a helical prop blade. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade angle for a helical prop is given by A = arctan(P/2*pi*R) where P is 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the constant pitch of the prop. When the offset angle T is small, the values 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of R along the radius perpendicular to the prop axis and R along the curve are 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;close. Since A and C are complementary angles, the tangents are reciprocal 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and therefore C = arctan(2*pi*R/P). We also see that the change, da, in 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;perpendicular offset from the baseline to the offset line per change in radius, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;dR, is da = dR*sin(T) = dR*2*pi*r*C/360*R. Substituting arctan(2*pi*R/P) 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;for C gives us da = dR*2*pi*r*arctan(2*pi*R/P)/360*R. If we define the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;distances along the baseline as x, we get dx = SQRT(dR^2-da^2). (We can also use dx = 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;dR*cos(arcsin(2*pi*r*arctan(2*pi*R/P)/360*R)) to calculate dx, but the other 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is simpler to calculate and gives identical results.) These differential 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;equations could perhaps be integrated to give an exact equation for the offset 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;curve, but I chose an approximate calculation method. I stepped along the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;offset radius curve in fixed small increments of the radius, DR, calculating the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a increment, Da, and x increment, Dx, accumulating each to get successive 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;values of a and x as I went along to the tip, as shown in the following 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;examples.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A George Perryman Propeller
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;“The drawing for the Great Speckled Bird that was in the 1992 NFFS Sympo 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;shows prop blades about 10 inches long and says that they are formed on a 6 inch 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;diameter form at an angle of 15 degrees which gives about 45 degrees total 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;twist. The prop is supposed to be 26 inches diam by 28 inches pitch.” From 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;an Internet discussion.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This reports the method of setting the can formed blade to achieve 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;approximately the desired helical P/D with the example of a prop attributed to George 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perryman. Later, the coordinates of a Piednoir curve are calculated to lay 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;out a curved blade radius producing an exact helical pitch.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The propeller has a diameter of 26&quot; and a pitch of 28&quot;. The blade has a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;length of 10&quot;, extending from a radius of 3&quot; to the tip at 13&quot;. The nominal P/D 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is 28/26 = 1.077. For a helical prop, the blade angle at the tip would be 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;arctan(28/26*pi) = 18.92 degrees. The blade angle at the root would be 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;arctan(28/6*pi) = 56.05 degrees. The difference in these angles is 37.13 degrees, not 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;45 degrees. This is the total twist along the 10&quot; length of the blade. The 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;blade twists at a uniform rate of 3.713 degrees per inch. The required offset 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;angle for a 6&quot; diameter can is arcsin(2*pi*3*37.13/360*10) = 11.21 degrees. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Note this is not the 15 degrees stated in the original description. More on 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that later.) This blade may be set so that both ends have blade angles as stated 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;above, corresponding to a pitch of 28&quot; at both the root and tip of the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;blade. From the uniform rate of twist, the blade angle at each 1&quot; station along 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the blade may be calculated, as well as the local pitch and P/D. I find that 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the pitch has a maximum value of 38.56 at 8&quot; radius and a P/D of 1.48. The 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;average pitch is 34.43&quot;, corresponding to an average P/D of 1.32. This is not the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;prop we thought we were going to get. Rather than setting this prop at the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;tips, let's set it to match a helical blade angle at the 70% radius, 9.1&quot;. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The required blade angle is arctan(28/18.2*pi) = 26.09 degrees. Again, from the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;uniform twist rate, we can calculate the blade angles, local pitches and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;P/D's for each 1&quot; station along the blade radius. The blade angle at the tip is 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;11.61 degrees, with a pitch of 16.78&quot; and P/D of 0.645. The root blade angle 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is 48.71 degrees with a pitch of 21.46 and P/D of 0.826. The highest pitch is 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;29.52&quot; at 7&quot; radius and the P/D is 1.135. The average pitch is 25.24&quot; for an 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;average P/D of 0.971, about 10.9% low. Note that there are two points along 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the radius where pitch is 28&quot;. The can formed blade angle line crosses the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;helical blade angle curve in two points.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that another set point will produce a closer average pitch 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and nominal P/D.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried calculating a blade formed at a 15 degree offset angle on a 6&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;diameter can and found that it is not possible to set it so the root and tip blade 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;angles match any helical prop. The blade will have 49.43 degrees of twist 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;from root to tip, at a uniform rate of 4.943 degrees per inch. There is too much 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;twist on this blade to fit any helical curve between the root and tip radii.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade formed at a 15 degree offset angle may be set to match the helical 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;blade angle at 70% radius. Again, the 28/26 P/D helical blade has a blade 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;angle of 26.09 degrees at a 9.1&quot; radius. The uniform rate of twist allows 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;calculation of blade angle, pitch and P/D, as before. The blade angle at the root 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is 56.24 degrees, the pitch is 28.20 and the P/D is 1.085. The blade angle at 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the tip is 6.81 degrees, the pitch is 9.75 &quot; and the P/D is 0.375. The 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;maximum pitch was 33.25&quot; at 6&quot; radius, with P/D of 1.279. The average pitch is 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;26.23&quot; for an average P/D of 1.009.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it may be possible, with judicious selection of can radius, offset 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;angle and set points, to closely approximate a desired average pitch, there 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;are significant departures from the desired P/D, pitch and blade angles. What 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;do these significant variations do to the efficiency of the prop? It seems 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that much of the prop will not be operating at an efficient blade angle. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a way to vary the rate of twist to more closely approximate the blade 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;angle curve for a helical prop. It utilizes an offset curve with a varying 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;angle to the baseline.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The coordinates of the Piednoir curve for this prop, 26&quot; diameter, 28&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;pitch, formed on a 6&quot; diameter can, were calculated. Using DR = (1) simplifies 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the calculations. The numbers are calculated from Da = (1)* 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2*pi*r*arctan(2*pi*R/P)/360*R and Dx = SQRT(1-Da^2). The values of a and x are the cumulative 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;sums of Da and Dx. R is the distance along the radius curve, x is the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;distance along the baseline and a is the perpendicular offset from the baseline to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the radius curve.

&nbsp;&nbsp;radius. The swept diameter will not be the full 26&quot;. The angle between the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;baseline and the line connecting the endpoints is 27.11 degrees, the angle which 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the radius curve chord should make to the plane of rotation at the hub.

<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The 45 degree blade angle occurs at 3.63&quot; radius.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This produces a curve which departs only 0.2&quot; from a straight line drawn 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;with an offset angle of 27.32 degrees. It might seem that there would be little 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;difference between a blade laid out on this curve and one laid out along a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;27.32 degree straight line. That is not correct, because a 0.2&quot; difference on a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2&quot; radius can makes an angular difference of 5.73 degrees, enough to push an 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;efficient blade attack angle close to a stall. The difference is even more 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;important for lower P/D props because there is an even greater difference in 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;blade angle along their radius.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This produces a curve which has a 5.98&quot; chord plotted flat and 5.89&quot; when on 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the can.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To use this curve to form a prop, plot x and a on a piece of paper with x 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;going to the right and a going up. This makes a right handed prop. Plot the prop 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;chords parallel with the a axis, centered on the curve. Connect the dots to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;form the perimeter of the blade. The leading edge is the top curve. Use this 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;shape to make a cardboard template for cutting out blades. The blades are 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;made from 1/32&quot; sheet balsa. Orient the x axis parallel with the grain. Mark the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;45 degree chord on both sides of each blade. Make as many paper patterns as 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;you want blades. Wrap the paper patterns around the can(s) with the x axis 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;parallel with the centerline of the can and the a axis circumferential. You may 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;want to cover the patterns with plastic film to protect them from the we 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;tblade.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The blades on a 12&quot; prop are typically 5&quot; long with an inch of balsa dowel 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;projecting inward from the root. The dowel is a tight friction fit in a paper, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;plastic or aluminum tube hub. It will be necessary to place the dowel from 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the prop center point at an angle of 27.32 degrees to the chord of the radius 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;curve and projecting about an inch into the blade. A slot is cut in the blade 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;for the dowel to fit inside. The slot should be incorporated into the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;cardboard blade pattern. When the dowels are fit into the tube hub, the chords 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;marked at the 45 degree radii can be used to set the angles of the blades in the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;hub. Set the marked chords so they make a right angle with each other and the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;prop shaft bisects one of the right angles. You can judge this very closely 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;by eye. You also can lightly strap bits of 1/16&quot; square balsa to the blades 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;at the 45 degree chords with lose rubber bands, so the sticks project beyond 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the blades. You can sight along the diameter of the prop and set the sticks 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to form the proper angles.
