10th Pikes Peak Ceiling Climb - March 6, 2016
<br />
<br /><br />Don DeLoach, CD
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Its hard to believe it has been ten years since this contest got its 
<br />
start. What fun we've had over the years! Lots of great flying, lots of 
<br />
site records set and broken. Despite rent increases and dwindling flying 
<br />
hours, Indoor is alive and well in Colorado.
<br />
<br /><br />This year we had 17 paid flyers with us including six out of state 
<br />
flyers. Dave Saks, our old friend from Idaho, was here. George 
<br />
Bredehoft, a mostly outdoor FAC flyer from Michigan made the trek via 
<br />
airline, and stayed at Chez DeLoach. George is the proprieter of Volare 
<br />
Products and Superior Props, and a super nice fellow.
<br />
<br /><br />Mike Fedor drove up from the Dallas area for a follow up to his Indoor 
<br />
Nats visit in 2015. It was great seeing Mike as usual, and he did some 
<br />
very fine flying.
<br />
<br /><br />Speaking of the 2015 Nats, John Lovins was inspired to come back in 
<br />
Indoor after spectating at the Nats. He came to the PPCC flying 35cm, 
<br />
A-6, and vows to tackle F1D next. What a pleasure it was to fly with 
<br />
John again.
<br />
<br /><br />David and Tiger Wagner came up from Santa Fe to their first PPCC, and 
<br />
seemed to enjoy themselves a lot. Tiger brought his school buddy with 
<br />
(can't remember his name)
<br />
<br /><br />Jim Gadd is a local Colorado Springs flyer who entered his first contest 
<br />
in Limited Pennyplane, and turned a very respectable 4:40. Welcome, Jim!
<br />
<br /><br />Two site records were broken this year, in Towline (DD with 54.4 best 
<br />
flight) and 35cm (John Lovins' 13:57). Our site records are getting 
<br />
tougher and tougher to beat.
<br />
<br /><br />The most popular events were P-18 with 8 flyers, Limited Pennyplane with 
<br />
7, and Towline and No-cal with 6 each. Isn't it interesting how quickly 
<br />
P-18 has caught on?
<br />
<br /><br />Jace Pivonka topped the very competitive 8-man field in P-18 with an 
<br />
awesome 2:10. His backup flight of 2:09 would also have placed first.
<br />
<br /><br />We lost Ivan Williams to cancer just a couple weeks before this year's 
<br />
PPCC. Ivan was a fixture in the Colorado Springs Indoor scene for many 
<br />
years, and a prolific builder. He donated his entire fleet of models to 
<br />
the MMM Club, and we auctioned them off at the PPCC, with proceed going 
<br />
to the club. What a huge success this was! Over $500 was raised and 
<br />
several dozen models now have happy new homes. RIP Ivan, and thanks. You 
<br />
won't soon be forgotten. Other donors to this silent auction were Don 
<br />
Uhl, Darold Jones, Jerry Murphy, and Rick Pangell. I want to offer 
<br />
special thanks to John McGrath for picking up most of Ivan's models to 
<br />
bring to the auction. Also, Rick Pangell and Ray Boyd brought down Don 
<br />
Uhl's models from Denver. Thanks guys!
<br />
<br /><br />The PPCC is a team effort. Thanks to Mark Covington for sitting at the 
<br />
CD most of the day and timing flights. Thanks to Jerry Murphy for 
<br />
bringing the beer and soft drinks for the pizza dinner. Thanks to anyone 
<br />
else who contirbuted in small but important ways. Your help is always 
<br />
greatly appreciated.
<br />
<br /><br />One final note of thanks, to John Berryman, David Gee, Bill Gowen and 
<br />
Tom Juell. These men pledged several hundred dollars to keep the PPCC 
<br />
solvent, when a call went out that our rent had been raised. NONE of 
<br />
them were even in attendance but their offers of financial assistance 
<br />
gave us much needed peace of mind. Fortunately, their money was not 
<br />
needed as the PPCC came within $20 of breaking even.
<br />
<br /><br />See you next year!
