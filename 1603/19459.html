<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Many people took personal offense to that. But that was OK to say? Then what happened? The discussion stopped dead in the water. No one wanted to talk anymore and the whole list died for days. Why is that? Because of the way the people were treated. They did not want to participate anymore. I am tired of this happening over and over again. It is not necessary to make digs at the indoor community to make a point. We ALL know that indoor is getting smaller we all know more people need to fly, we all know indoor needs more exposure etc. We ALL know it. But rubbing our noses in it and calling those people elitists etc only pisses the people off that are needed to help solve the problem. I have had 15 years of listening to this approach from the same person and I am at my wits end.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If people want to truly discuss the future of indoor it can be done in a much more constructive way. But the current approach only alienates the majority of the indoor flyers. So all that happens is people all shut up and don't post a word, no discussion happens and the can gets kicked down the road another year and another year and another year.
