Nor is it the venue for him to repeatedly bad mouth the indoor 
<br />
community. There was a discussion that started a few weeks back what do 
<br />
to get more beginners in and then this was posted
<br />
<br />*&quot;No offense but most Indoor flyers are not the right personality type.&quot; 
<br />
*saying  we are like like *&quot;..cooks, kitchen staff and dishwashers, none 
<br />
of whom interact with customers....&quot;
<br />
*
<br />
Many people took personal offense to that. But that was OK to say? Then 
<br />
what happened? The discussion stopped dead in the water. No one wanted 
<br />
to talk anymore and the whole list died for days. Why is that? Because 
<br />
of the way the people were treated. They did not want to participate 
<br />
anymore. I am tired of this happening over and over again. It is not 
<br />
necessary to make digs at the indoor community to make a point. We ALL 
<br />
know that indoor is getting smaller we all know more people need to fly, 
<br />
we all know indoor needs more exposure etc. We ALL know it. But rubbing 
<br />
our noses in it and calling those people elitists etc only pisses the 
<br />
people off that are needed to help solve the problem. I have had 15 
<br />
years of listening to this approach from the same person and I am at my 
<br />
wits end.
<br />
<br />If people want to truly discuss the future of indoor it can be done in a 
<br />
much more constructive way. But the current approach only alienates the 
<br />
majority of the indoor flyers. So all that happens is people all shut up 
<br />
and don't post a word, no discussion happens and the can gets kicked 
<br />
down the road another year and another year and another year.
<br />
<br />Since I am the one who is in the wrong. I will gladly leave the group. I 
<br />
apologize to all.
