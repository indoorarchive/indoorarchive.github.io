It would be very unfortunate if Don S left the group.  He is local to me so we fly together often, and I can tell you that he is always willing to help anybody, especially beginners.  And he is one heck of nice guy.  As are all indoor fliers that I have met.  We all have our quirks, but in all of the aeromodeling I do, I find the indoor crowd to be the one I enjoy most.  Not say other crowds aren't good, just that I have personally seen the most comradery and competition in indoor. Nobody I have met wants beginners to fail.  At the first local club meet I attended a former world champion took a look at a model that wasn't doing so well and helped me get it flying.  He didn't know me, and didn't have to do that, but he did.  My experiences with the indoor crowd have been nothing but positive and helpful.
<br />
<br />Like Josh said, we have a contest coming up,and I for one, am looking forward to seeing everyone at Baden this weekend.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Don S., I hope you're not seriously looking to leave the group. I for one have benefitted greatly from your contributions even when we disagree about techniques and the like.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Guys, let's be realistic, Don's right. The can keeps getting kicked down the road because insults keep being thrown by key individuals at the indoor community at large. Worse, those insults are based on the false premise that indoor is getting harder through more complex competition events when the reverse is actually true--Indoor has *never* been easier than it is right now, regardless of the desperate search by F1D fliers (myself included) for more 5/99. Nick Ray blew me out of the water on Saturday flying 10/97, which depending on the model, can provide comparable performance to the newest SS batches. That wasn't merely a contest win, it was a national record--with something not labeled 5/99.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indoor may be hard work, but so are the scale events flown by so many who are critical of indoor. I find it ironic that a pennyplane is readily achievable for someone like my wife, but she'll never get the tissue on a scale job well enough to have a winning airplane because her hands just are not steady enough to do it. She's not alone in that arena, I see many whos struggle there. I've personally gotten that skill by having fought with tissue covering for most of my life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now then, we've got a big contest this weekend. Let's stop verbally shooting each other and get to work making indoor look as inviting as it is beautiful. Show those spectators that it isn't so impossible to get into it.
