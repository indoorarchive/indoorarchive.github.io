This file requires a bit of explanation.
<br />

<br />
On Saturday it was cold, windy and raining most of the day. As Bill Gowen noted, the conditions inside were terrible, the worst anyone had ever seen. 
<br />

<br />
The data here was captured every minute over the course of both days at West Baden.
<br />
The graph here is from Saturday's data.
<br />

<br />
What is listed as Series1-5 here are sensors at various heights in the dome.
<br />
The balloon carrying the sensors was on a table nearby where I was set up.
<br />
The sensors were placed immediately under a 3' balloon, 5' below, 10' below, 20' below and at the base around 3' off the floor. I don't have the exact height of the balloon, but it was right at the second obvious ring on the dome, roughly 50' from the edge. 
<br />

<br />
What you can see from the data is that the temps at the top were roughly 4 degrees cooler than the floor the entire day. Sensor 3 I have noticed tracks about .7 degrees warmer than the rest - if compensated for here, the air from 5-20' below is remarkably homogeneous, and about half a degree warmer than at the base of the balloon itself. 
<br />

<br />
What we saw happening was the center of the room was turbulent and mostly down drafts all day long. At the edges of the building, there was a small updraft. In essence, we had a torus-shaped reverse thermal going on all day long. The data supports this very well, showing how the air would cool as it rose, then fall in the center.
<br />

<br />
Regards.
<br />
