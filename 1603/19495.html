There is some other interesting data for the West Baden Atrium &quot;weather&quot; last weekend.  My wife and I were able to get some infrared thermal temperature data from the Atrium surfaces.  For all of Saturday and early Sunday, the walls were warmer than the either the floor (actual floor) or ceiling girders (the walls are heated by the room HVAC systems).  This contributes to a convection pattern the where the air goes up the walls and falls down in the center, as Mike mentioned.  These thermal conditions do not change, even at night, as the floor stays cool radiating heat to the good ceiling (and sky).  On Sunday, just after lunch time, the cloud cover lessened and the floor (and upper girders) started to warm up.  By about 3pm Sunday, the walls temperatures were no longer warmer than the floor and the more usually West Baden Atrium thermal pattern emerged.  The flying conditions after this were &quot;good enough.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Something was happening on Saturday.  There were windows open to the second floor, many just above the office lobby atrium entrance (just counter clockwise from where the fliers were setup.  Air was blowing out these windows as the second floor interior air handlers were running.  This air flow and the air flow in and out the four main atrium entrances (and into the air return vents just under the second floor windows) contributed to making a great deal of low level turbulence, especially near the office lobby entrance and atrium center.  My wife and I traced this airflow on Saturday after the flying ended.  On Sunday morning, we closed the open windows, needing to wedge each with paper wedge to keep them from blowing open again.  I thought the the turbulence was much less on Sunday morning and I was able to get some decent quarter motor flights completed with two different F1D's.  Just after 1:30 pm, the turbulence had lessened enough to allow an vp equipped F1D to get to the top of the &quot;pancake.&quot;  Then the real flying began.
