I have been out of town for the past week since the EAA event.  I knew there was trouble brewing on this list before, and after the event.   
<br />
&nbsp;I started indoor flying in 1987, my first NATS I met 'The Don's' in Lincoln Nebraska.  Thirty years later I consider both of them my friends, although they may not say the same of each other.  They are really both great people who have done more for the sport than we ever dreamed as the only three teenagers at the NATS.  Yes, there were only three teens at the NATS, indoor has been dying for 30 years.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;If I only knew the Don's from their postings here, I would hate to guess what my impression would be.  I can say they are still both serious competitors.  Perhaps the competitive nature means neither want to bow out of an argument, or lose one, I get that as I have a competitive streak as well.  I hate to see that desire to win turn ugly as it has here.  These two are better than this if you know them in person.  It is hard for me to read the comments as I feel it only tarnishes the images of two people who represent our sport both in person and in our modelling press.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;I think the way to settle this is to have both pick two events at the indoor and outdoor NATS this year.  The events are close enough to make it happen.  Whoever has a higher combined placing in indoor and outdoor will be crowned the Supreme Champion, and have sole rights to express their opinion without rebuttal.  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Yes I am kidding, no it will not happen.  If it did I am sure it would be more entertaining than Celebrity Death Match.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Also, in regards to the EAA event...It was a real treat to have Don S. and Chuck attend this year.  The event is a competition, but having fun is just as important.  The camaraderie at the EAA Lodge every evening is a big part of the event, even Chuck said it was like the old Navy Nats.  The video he posted shows some of this in fine form.  The thing that I remember the most after every EAA indoor event is handing a kid an indoor model to launch for the first time.  As it leaves their hand and circles slowly above them up to the ceiling it is awesome to watch their eyes get bigger and their smile get larger as the model goes higher.  That is why all of us are here, at some point in our &quot;career&quot; we were that kid, no matter how old we were.  That feeling is what we are all seeking to preserve for ourselves and future generations.
