Don S., I hope you're not seriously looking to leave the group. I for one have benefitted greatly from your contributions even when we disagree about techniques and the like.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Guys, let's be realistic, Don's right. The can keeps getting kicked down the road because insults keep being thrown by key individuals at the indoor community at large. Worse, those insults are based on the false premise that indoor is getting harder through more complex competition events when the reverse is actually true--Indoor has *never* been easier than it is right now, regardless of the desperate search by F1D fliers (myself included) for more 5/99. Nick Ray blew me out of the water on Saturday flying 10/97, which depending on the model, can provide comparable performance to the newest SS batches. That wasn't merely a contest win, it was a national record--with something not labeled 5/99.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Indoor may be hard work, but so are the scale events flown by so many who are critical of indoor. I find it ironic that a pennyplane is readily achievable for someone like my wife, but she'll never get the tissue on a scale job well enough to have a winning airplane because her hands just are not steady enough to do it. She's not alone in that arena, I see many whos struggle there. I've personally gotten that skill by having fought with tissue covering for most of my life.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Now then, we've got a big contest this weekend. Let's stop verbally shooting each other and get to work making indoor look as inviting as it is beautiful. Show those spectators that it isn't so impossible to get into it.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
