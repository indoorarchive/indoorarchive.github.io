<br />Hi Karol,
<br />
<br />Our weekend in Lakehurst was the kind that strikes fear in the hearts 
<br />
of Team Selection Committee Chairmen.
<br />
<br />Saturday started with fairly decent air, but undesirable winds 
<br />
outside blowing lengthwise down the hanger generated an annoying 
<br />
drift inside.  4 minutes took you a quarter of the way down the 
<br />
floor.  
<br />
<br />Jim Richmond tried a flight with his HLS, but it was near the wall 
<br />
within 6 minutes, well before the prop folded.  During the steer the 
<br />
prop flipped and grabbed on to the steering line.  He tried to free 
<br />
it, but the wing collapsed.
<br />
<br />Tom Iacobellis had a motor break in-flight on his HLS, neatly 
<br />
separating it into two pieces.
<br />
<br />My F1D quickly drifted off the carrier deck on a ¼ motor flight, and 
<br />
while working on steering it I bumped into Tony D'Alessandro's model 
<br />
stand and broke his HLS wing spar.  Sorry Tony!
<br />
<br />Tony fixed the spar, but then planted his model in the rafters at the 
<br />
roof.  It collapsed during retrieval.
<br />
<br />Things got a little better Saturday evening and I did some good WC 
<br />
testing.  Then we headed over to the Italian place for dinner and a 
<br />
little Frank Sinatra music.
<br />
<br />Sunday started much better.  The air was great.  Sanborn put up an 
<br />
F1L flight that was within a minute of the national record.  Richmond 
<br />
started an HLS stick flight that looked great &#x2013; but then suffered an 
<br />
in-flight broken motor, too!  One second it was fine, then next it 
<br />
was an instant ball.
<br />
<br />Then it started getting dark.  I figured I'd continue with my 
<br />
testing, but when my ¼ motor flight shot up to the 4th catwalk at 9 
<br />
minutes, I knew something was very wrong.  Lighting, rain, and a 
<br />
stiff wind&#x2026;inside the building!  Everyone scrambled to get their 
<br />
models back in the boxes.  More than a few were broken in the 
<br />
process.  Keeping them out was even more dangerous.  You had to 
<br />
quickly find a wind shelter or face having your model wrecked in your 
<br />
hands.
<br />
<br />Once the storm front blew through the air calmed down a little, but 
<br />
it was still dismal.  Cold, rainy.  Not the best conditions for 
<br />
Lakehurst.
<br />
<br />So, overall, there were only several hours of good air.  But fans of 
<br />
Lakehurst take this kind of thing in stride.  We still had fun and 
<br />
look forward to the next chance to hit the magical good days.
<br />
