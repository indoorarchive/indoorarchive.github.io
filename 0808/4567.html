<br />
What a great couple of weeks!
<br />
<br />Any concerns I had about Belgrade proved completely unwarranted.  
<br />
Everyone we met was kind and helpful &#x2013; from the event coordinators to 
<br />
the taxi drivers to people on the street.  I felt perfectly safe 
<br />
walking from the hotel to get a slice of pizza around midnight or 
<br />
winding through the 200,000+ people at the Beer Fest during our off 
<br />
day &#x2013; even with my Team USA shirt on.  We toured the city, visited 
<br />
stunning landmarks like the fortress in the center of town, ate at 
<br />
nice restaurants, and had an all-around wonderful time.
<br />
<br />The International Open &quot;Pre-contest&quot; served as practice for the World 
<br />
Champs, both for the competitors and the organizers.  We quickly 
<br />
learned that the air was turbulent during the daytime when the 
<br />
sunlight beamed through the multitude of magnifying-glass type 
<br />
windows on the roof, but quickly calmed down around 4pm when the sun 
<br />
began to set.  The timers, however, began to bail out before then 
<br />
after having suffered through the heat for several hours.  It was 
<br />
difficult to secure one during the &quot;good air&quot;.
<br />
<br />This knowledge carried over to the WC.  The event directors kindly 
<br />
adjusted the rounds schedule so that we could fly in the good evening 
<br />
and nighttime air.  The modified format caused some logistics 
<br />
problems with food and transportation, but I think it was well worth 
<br />
it.  Flying comes first at the WC!  Timers weren't problem during the 
<br />
WC because each team gets an assigned pair.
<br />
<br />Congratulations to World Champion Ivan Treger.  His models looked 
<br />
simple and clean and had an amazingly solid flight pattern.  While 
<br />
some planes floundered during launch in the low-level daytime 
<br />
turbulence, his just rocked gently and went about their business.  
<br />
Ivan's Variable Pitch props worked nicely, too, with his last flight 
<br />
only peaking at about 75% height and still turning in 35:25.  His WC 
<br />
victory and new World Record are a clear indication of his 
<br />
preparation and skill.  Great job, Ivan!
<br />
<br />Silver medalist Lutz Schramm's models were on the other end of the 
<br />
complexity spectrum.  They featured parabolic wings, molded carbon 
<br />
prop outlines with a prop spar that stopped at the first rib, hollow 
<br />
molded carbon wing posts with an offset for adjusting wing warp, and 
<br />
a bevy of other innovations - a beautiful example of German precision 
<br />
engineering.
<br />
<br />I managed to hold on for the last podium spot, but there were several 
<br />
others in close contention for one of the top three places.  Jim 
<br />
Richmond lost three flights to steering problems resulting from 
<br />
vision and balance issues.  The matter was brought before the FAI 
<br />
Jury and after some consideration they decided that the empirical 
<br />
evidence before them was as convincing as any doctor's note and 
<br />
granted him a proxy steerer.  I was honored to do the duty and, a few 
<br />
steers later, Jim's next flight was a &quot;safe&quot; 33:10 backup that locked 
<br />
in the team win for the USA.  His final one was wound for bear, but 
<br />
the prop folded very late after losing most of its altitude and 
<br />
landed with a bunch of turns.
<br />
<br />We tease Doug Schaefer about his models and boxes (a few of his props 
<br />
looks like something out of Dr. Seuss), but you can't argue about his 
<br />
times.  Doug overcame a first round launch stall that touched just 
<br />
after the &quot;attempt window&quot; and posted a solid set of times to finish 
<br />
mere seconds behind Richmond and contribute to the convincing team 
<br />
win.
<br />
<br />As Karol mentioned, steering skill was once again an essential 
<br />
element in the top competitors' arsenal, and some of the most 
<br />
impressive examples I saw were by the Czech Junior team.  I'd guess 
<br />
that their youngest member was around 8, but they all demonstrated 
<br />
great form &#x2013; getting on and off the models cleanly with little 
<br />
altitude change, and moving the model on the line at the proper 
<br />
pace.  My only disagreement would be their choice to walk backwards 
<br />
during the steer (it seems too easy to trip), but the rest set a 
<br />
great example for others to follow (just remember to look up when you 
<br />
are walking back with your balloon! :) ).  Their models looked 
<br />
identical to Treger's, so I assume he is involved in their coaching.  
<br />
If so, their steering skill is another testament to the World 
<br />
Champion.
<br />
<br />Thank you to our Serbian hosts for organizing an excellent contest.  
<br />
I felt safe and secure, and very welcomed.  Anecdotally, on the 
<br />
second to last day I inadvertently left my camera and stopwatch on 
<br />
the table outside our cubicle.  The following morning it was 
<br />
missing.  We searched everywhere and even looked through the security 
<br />
guard's detailed log for the night.  Nothing.  Our hosts were very 
<br />
embarrassed that such a thing could happen.  Well, it turns out it 
<br />
didn't.  The organizer had seen the items lying out as he was leaving 
<br />
the night before and stowed them away for safe keeping.  Since he 
<br />
left late, he came back the next day around noon, items in hand.  
<br />
That was the closest thing to a problem that I experienced, and it 
<br />
wasn't even a problem!
<br />
<br />p.s. the food was great, too
<br />
