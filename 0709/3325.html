<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Paul Macready, Burt Rutan, Jean Luc Picard- at least 2 of my idols 
</em><br />
are still alive, too bad
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Paul B. MacCready, the Caltech-trained scientist and inventor who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; created the Gossamer Condor -- the first successful human-powered 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; airplane -- as well as other innovative aircraft, has died. He was 
</em><br />
81.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MacCready died in his sleep at his Pasadena home Tuesday, according 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to an announcement from AeroVironment Inc., the Monrovia-based 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; company he founded. The statement said he had been recently 
</em><br />
diagnosed 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with a serious ailment but the cause of death was not listed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An accomplished meteorologist, a world-class glider pilot and a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; respected aeronautical engineer, MacCready headed the team that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; designed and built the Gossamer Condor and the Gossamer Albatross --
</em><br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two flimsy, awkward-looking planes powered by a furiously pedaling 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bicycle racer -- that won him international fame and $300,000 in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prize money.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; He also built and flew a radio-controlled replica of a prehistoric 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pterodactyl, the largest creature that ever took to the air.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; His successes in these and other imaginative projects led to more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than 30 prestigious awards, including the Collier Trophy for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; achievement in aeronautics and astronautics, and five honorary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; degrees.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The slight, pale, bespectacled MacCready said it all probably 
</em><br />
stemmed 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from a rather nerdy childhood.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;I was always the smallest kid in the class,&quot; he told the National 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Aviation Hall of Fame. &quot;I was not especially coordinated -- 
</em><br />
certainly 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not the athletic type -- and socially immature.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;And so, when I began getting into model airplanes, and getting 
</em><br />
into 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contests and creating new things, I probably got more psychological 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; benefit from that than I would have from some of the other typical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; school things,&quot; he said. &quot;Nobody seemed to be quite as motivated 
</em><br />
for 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the new and strange as I was.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There were those who denigrated MacCready's efforts, saying they 
</em><br />
had 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no practical value. He said his critics missed the point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic did not directly advance 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; airplane design,&quot; MacCready said. &quot;The plane was a lousy plane. It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was unstable and you couldn't see forward very well. You wouldn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want to design another like it. But it changed the world by being a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; catalyst for thinking about aviation.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lindbergh's plane, the Spirit of St. Louis, hangs today from a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ceiling at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Washington, D.C. Hanging next to it is MacCready's Gossamer Condor.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MacCready's foray into aviation history began as the result of a 
</em><br />
bad 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; loan.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In 1970, MacCready guaranteed a loan for a friend who wanted to 
</em><br />
start 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a business building fiberglass catamarans. When the company failed, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MacCready found himself $100,000 in debt.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Casting around for a way to deal with that problem, he recalled a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cash prize offered by British industrialist Henry Kremer to anyone 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who built a human-powered plane capable of sustained, controlled 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flight.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;The Kremer prize, in which I'd had no interest, was just about 
</em><br />
equal 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to my debt,&quot; MacCready said. &quot;Suddenly, human-powered flight seemed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; important.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To win the prize, he had to create an airplane that could take off 
</em><br />
on 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its own and fly a figure-eight, 1.15-mile course, clearing 10-foot 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hurdles at the beginning and end. Several people had tried; all had 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; failed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MacCready said he studied the soaring flights of hawks and 
</em><br />
vultures, 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculating the amount of lift needed to keep the birds aloft and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comparing that with what he knew about gliders.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; He concluded that if he could triple the wingspan of a glider 
</em><br />
without 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increasing its weight, the power needed to keep it aloft in level 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flight would be only about four-tenths of one horsepower. He knew 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that a well-conditioned athlete could produce about that, and maybe 
</em><br />
a 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; little more, for an extended period.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The spindly, translucent Gossamer Condor that resulted was crafted 
</em><br />
of 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aluminum tubing, plastic sheeting, piano wire and Scotch tape. It 
</em><br />
had 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a wingspan of 90 feet but weighed only 70 pounds. The pilot was 
</em><br />
Bryan 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Allen, a strong, slender bicycle racer who powered the single 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propeller by pedaling a drive chain made largely of old bicycle 
</em><br />
parts.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Condor flew from the outset, but not well. However, because it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flew so slowly and at such a low height -- about 10 mph and about 
</em><br />
15 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feet -- MacCready was able to improve its design through trial and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; error.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The bizarre aircraft crashed scores of times during flight tests, 
</em><br />
but 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Allen always emerged relatively unscathed. MacCready noted dryly 
</em><br />
that 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his crash-and-rebuild system worked all right for the Condor, &quot;but 
</em><br />
it 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not the way to develop airliners.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Finally, on Aug. 23, 1977, the Condor made a successful seven-
</em><br />
minute 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flight over a figure-eight course laid out around the airport in 
</em><br />
the 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dusty San Joaquin Valley farming town of Shafter. MacCready claimed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Kremer prize and was celebrated as the father of human-powered 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flight.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;We're at last achieving a goal that man has had for thousands of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years,&quot; he said.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Within months, Kremer had offered a prize of about $213,000 for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first human-powered flight across the English Channel.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MacCready immediately began improving the Condor. What emerged was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Gossamer Albatross, which he described as a &quot;next-step clone.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The biggest difference was its stronger, lighter frame, made of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carbon fiber tubing instead of aluminum.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On June 12, 1979, with Allen at the pedals, the Albatross took off 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from Folkestone, England, and headed east. Fighting head winds and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; turbulence for the better part of three hours, Allen overcame 
</em><br />
cramps 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and exhaustion to land successfully on the beach at Cap Gris-Nez, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; France.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kremer called it a &quot;splendid achievement&quot; and handed over the prize 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; money.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Six months later, MacCready's ultralight Gossamer Penguin, powered 
</em><br />
by 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a 2.75-horsepower motor that ran on electricity generated by solar 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; panels atop the fuselage, skimmed over the Arizona desert in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first climbing flight powered by sunlight.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In 1981, a similar plane, MacCready's Solar Challenger, flew 180 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; miles from Paris, France, to Kent, England. A few years later, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another of his human-powered aircraft, the Bionic Bat, won two more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kremer prizes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In one of his greatest flights of fancy, MacCready then enlisted 
</em><br />
the 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; help of engineer Henry Jex to create and fly a wing-flapping, radio-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; controlled, half-scale replica of a pterodactyl, a creature with a 
</em><br />
36-
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; foot wingspan that last soared over Mesozoic landscapes more than 
</em><br />
60 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; million years ago.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;If you can make something that moves around but gives you the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feeling of a prehistoric creature, then people experience it; they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feel it much better,&quot; MacCready said in a magazine interview.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In 1987, his GM Sunraycer, a streamlined vehicle the size of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; soapbox derby entry, easily won a 1,867-mile race in Australia 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against other, larger, solar-powered cars.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some of his later creations were big, like the Helios, an unmanned, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solar-powered plane with 14 electric motors and a 200-foot wingspan 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that climbed to more than 96,000 feet. It was the highest altitude 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ever achieved by a propeller-driven aircraft.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some were small, like his surveillance planes, the size of a man's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hand, that carried tiny television cameras.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some didn't work, like a little plane powered by a hamster.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Hamsters are lazy,&quot; he lamented.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The son of a prosperous physician, Paul Beattie MacCready was born 
</em><br />
in 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; New Haven, Conn., on Sept. 29, 1925.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By the time he was 14, he had designed and built a number of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unconventional model planes, including an autogyro that flew for 
</em><br />
more 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than 12 minutes, outlasting the best efforts of adults entered in 
</em><br />
the 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same competition. Two years later, he tried his hand in real 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; airplanes, earning a pilot's license.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; He entered Yale in 1943, at the same time signing up for training 
</em><br />
as 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a Navy pilot. His studies were interrupted occasionally by flight 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; training, but World War II ended before he graduated; he never saw 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; combat.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In 1947, MacCready bought an Army surplus glider and, combining his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Navy flight skills with his Yale training in meteorology, he soon 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; became an expert glider pilot. He invented a system that is still 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; used to calculate optimum flight speeds between thermal air 
</em><br />
currents.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A year later, MacCready earned a master's degree in physics at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Caltech and won the first of three national soaring championships.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In 1951, he founded Meteorology Research Inc., which quickly became 
</em><br />
a 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leader in weather modification technology and the manufacture of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remote-controlled aircraft for atmospheric research.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MacCready received a doctorate in aeronautics from Caltech in 1952, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and in 1956, he became the first American to win the World Champion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Soaring Contest.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Several years later, he founded AeroVironment, which produces 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electronic systems, surveillance aircraft and experimental, energy-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; efficient cars and boats. The firm also builds systems to monitor 
</em><br />
and 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reduce air pollution and hazardous waste.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MacCready often stressed the importance of independent thought.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;You will find that your teachers are sometimes wrong,&quot; he told a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; group of Santa Monica schoolchildren in 1998.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Your parents will be wrong. Your schools will be wrong. If you 
</em><br />
look 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the answers yourself, you will find that you can do better.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann, a close friend, attributed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MacCready's creativity to his outlook.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;He approaches nature and daily life with an innocent sense of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wonder,&quot; Gell-Mann told Time magazine in 1990.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;He approaches problems and learning about new things in the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way: without strongly held, preconceived notions. When he sees 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something, he takes a fresh view of it.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MacCready is survived by his wife, Judy; three sons, Parker, Tyler 
</em><br />
