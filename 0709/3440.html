<br />
The big question over past years was whether a prop could be re-pitched 
<br />
by cutting the blades off the hub, setting them to the desired angle, 
<br />
and re-gluing.
<br />
<br />This would seem more accurate and reliable than the &quot;accepted&quot; method of 
<br />
heating the prop bases and twisting them, and not break the spirit of 
<br />
the rule. One might also conceive of a tubular splint that would let the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;pitch be adjusted for experimental flights, then glued to a fixed 
<br />
&quot;best&quot; position for the contest. In fact there are Ikara prop kits that 
<br />
are designed for this, but they come in parts rather than a single piece.
<br />
<br />The &quot;single piece&quot; requirement would seem to preclude any VP gizmos, as 
<br />
a vp prop is a multipiece assembly, if it has springs or bearings or 
<br />
swivels or hinges.
<br />
<br />The single piece rule dates back to the day when they required a single 
<br />
piece injection molded prop, which made sense from a rules semantics 
<br />
standpoint. One cast component. Then scraping was allowed- that was 
<br />
controversial in its day. The Ikaras are made up of a hub with glued on 
<br />
blades, and could be argued to be three piece props, though they are 
<br />
glued or welded together. Nonetheless, they became &quot;defacto&quot; accepted 
<br />
and allowed great improvements in buildability and performance.
<br />
<br />&quot;manufactured&quot; is another loose term. IF anyone on this list decided to 
<br />
manufacture a few hundred (or tens or 1000s?) of props using the allowed 
<br />
materials and make them available to the public, certainly that would 
<br />
qualify.  (hint) Careful materials choices and blade design could 
<br />
conceivably be used to create a self flaring prop that came pretty close 
<br />
to the best VP performance...
<br />
<br />I recall my amazement when I learned that Ikaras were accepted. I saw 
<br />
them the year before and concluded immediately that they were not &quot;one 
<br />
piece&quot; and so would not be acceptable. But they eliminated scraping, and 
<br />
were such an improvement that anyone with any free flight experience 
<br />
could not bear to force the kids back to those old plastic clunkers!
