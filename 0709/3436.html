<br />
I believe that good online groups such as this one have two 
<br />
overlapping constituencies--two good motives to join and 
<br />
participate.  One is for relevant, current, or rare information about 
<br />
the hobby, the other for social interaction--to enjoy the feeling of 
<br />
belonging among FF friends.  Indoorists are normally flung far and 
<br />
wide from each other geographically, so the ersatz-clubhouse function 
<br />
provided by online chat may be more important than we suppose.  The 
<br />
informational aspect sometimes  becomes merely the backdrop or 
<br />
premise for a major reason people check in--being to talk, or read 
<br />
others' talk.   The two motives aren't mutually exclusive, of course, 
<br />
and can coexist.  However the narrowness of the topic &quot;Indoor Free 
<br />
Flight&quot;  (or my interpretation of what that means) has probably 
<br />
minimized the &quot;social need&quot; facet.  I sometimes sense good members 
<br />
chomping at the bit, or outright rattling my cage to just talk about 
<br />
*whatever* in the absence of real news or indoor substance. Me, I'm 
<br />
now FINE when days or a week go by without a post--or at least that's 
<br />
to be preferred to off-topic posts (which seldom appear, 
<br />
thankfully .)  But some disagree, and they understandably crave 
<br />
action, any kind.  So, I get occasionally chided as a boogeyman of 
<br />
sorts, or ready to  have a cow in front of everyone.  Not exactly 
<br />
true--I don't mind being a diligent moderator, which includes a 
<br />
police function, but I do resent the periodic  references to me 
<br />
being  &quot;about ready to get mad&quot; at someone, or the like.  I don't get 
<br />
mad, I draw lines. Please, just take it like a man, without blaming 
<br />
me!  (Notable exception--I got mad and therefore started Ind_Const. 
<br />
Group due to Off-topic disregard shown in previous group.)  I 
<br />
digress. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Anyhow, I propose to set up a sort of Sister Station to 
<br />
Indoor_Construction, maybe called Coffee Shop Indoor.  I suggest not 
<br />
having limiting rules about content--only normal civility, if that 
<br />
can exist. It's very possible that just as much or more good indoor 
<br />
discussion can arise  or be imbedded within the way indoorists talk 
<br />
when they/we gather for coffee and breakfast just before a flying day 
<br />
at Kibbie Dome, for example.   I will_not_be THE moderator or even a 
<br />
moderator for Indoor Coffee Shop so I'm open to suggestions.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Where would this leave Indoor_Constuction?  It probably will risk 
<br />
being buried or whithering away.  But hopefully those who have always 
<br />
appreciated the (beautiful) narrowness of Indoor_Construction can 
<br />
help keep it alive with their own regular posts, and also I'll try to 
<br />
talk someone(s) into copy-pasting any relevant indoor content that 
<br />
may appear in the proposed sister station.  Maybe I'll do that part 
<br />
myself for a little while.  Then, what happens, happens.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Regular posters please PM me with your thoughts about this.
