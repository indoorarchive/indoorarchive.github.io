I don't see a need for another group. There is little enough participation without diluting it further. I might occasionally be guilty of stretching the group rules, but it's usually in response to a question raised by others. It's easier to just give an answer or opinion here than directing someone to a more appropriate group, even though that might annoy someone who would only like to read about the latest thinking in VP spring design.
<br />
<br />Speaking of VP's, I remember a year or two ago that VP's were specifically banned from SO competition but I can't find any official rules that state that prohibition. Does anyone remember how that went down?

<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that good online groups such as this one have two 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;overlapping constituencies--two good motives to join and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;participate. One is for relevant, current, or rare information about 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the hobby, the other for social interaction--to enjoy the feeling of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;belonging among FF friends. Indoorists are normally flung far and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;wide from each other geographically, so the ersatz-clubhouse function 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;provided by online chat may be more important than we suppose. The 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;informational aspect sometimes becomes merely the backdrop or 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;premise for a major reason people check in--being to talk, or read 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;others' talk. The two motives aren't mutually exclusive, of course, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and can coexist. However the narrowness of the topic &quot;Indoor Free 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Flight&quot; (or my interpretation of what that means) has probably 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;minimized the &quot;social need&quot; facet. I sometimes sense good members 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;chomping at the bit, or outright rattling my cage to just talk about 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;*whatever* in the absence of real news or indoor substance. Me, I'm 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;now FINE when days or a week go by without a post--or at least that's 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to be preferred to off-topic posts (which seldom appear, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;thankfully .) But some disagree, and they understandably crave 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;action, any kind. So, I get occasionally chided as a boogeyman of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;sorts, or ready to have a cow in front of everyone. Not exactly 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;true--I don't mind being a diligent moderator, which includes a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;police function, but I do resent the periodic references to me 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;being &quot;about ready to get mad&quot; at someone, or the like. I don't get 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;mad, I draw lines. Please, just take it like a man, without blaming 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;me! (Notable exception--I got mad and therefore started Ind_Const. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Group due to Off-topic disregard shown in previous group.) I 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;digress. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyhow, I propose to set up a sort of Sister Station to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Indoor_Construction, maybe called Coffee Shop Indoor. I suggest not 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;having limiting rules about content--only normal civility, if that 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;can exist. It's very possible that just as much or more good indoor 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;discussion can arise or be imbedded within the way indoorists talk 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;when they/we gather for coffee and breakfast just before a flying day 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;at Kibbie Dome, for example. I will_not_be THE moderator or even a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;moderator for Indoor Coffee Shop so I'm open to suggestions.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Where would this leave Indoor_Constuction? It probably will risk 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;being buried or whithering away. But hopefully those who have always 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;appreciated the (beautiful) narrowness of Indoor_Construction can 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;help keep it alive with their own regular posts, and also I'll try to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;talk someone(s) into copy-pasting any relevant indoor content that 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;may appear in the proposed sister station. Maybe I'll do that part 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;myself for a little while. Then, what happens, happens.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular posters please PM me with your thoughts about this.
