Thanks Mark.  I like that pic too.  But that was one of the easy shots to take. Nothing was moving and the lighting was overhead.  Try taking a picture of Ralph Ray's tip launch glider, through a zoom lens, standing in the unfortunate location of having it circle around you, while it alternates passing in front of dark wood then bright skylight, then dark wood...  I do need to practice more (photography), and I will if I can back in for another event.
<br />
<br />That picture has in interesting story, told here in far less than a thousand words.  The owner, in the brown shirt (sorry I'm a newbie-retread and don't know many names), told me he had never flown that model (which can bee seen in the four pics before and the four pics after) anywhere other than under a 25-foot (+/-) ceiling in a college gym near San Diego.  This was his first visit to the Tustin Blimp Hangar.  So he wound it up to it's full potential (uh-oh) just like he usually does.  He then set the model free and watched with delight/fear as it happily climbed past it's normal ceiling bumping altitude, then higher, and HIGHER...  At some point he exclaimed &quot;Oh Lord I Hope I Get It Back!&quot;  And that's why there were several very intent onlookers, including his friend on the left and my two kids on the right.
<br />
<br />His model flew 80-90% of the way to the top, circled a while, then descended.  It looked like it was flying in a silo the way it circled straight up and then straight back down.  It really was a beautiful flight.
<br />
<br />Paul
