Hi All,
<br />
<br />I think it's S.O. policy to not list event times any where, anymore.  
<br />
They only list placings within events and school rankings. Anyway,  
<br />
Nor-Cal State was an air-conditioner special. BLG started first and  
<br />
only the last  one had a problem that I know of. But, about 1/2 way  
<br />
through Wright Stuff things went down the drain when the AC went on.  
<br />
I went to the front desk people who then got on the phone with the  
<br />
expected results - nothing. The only model that did well earlier had  
<br />
a faulty log; I don't know how it got by their regional and it cost  
<br />
them 2nd place. There were 4 or 5 models of the 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 minute  
<br />
variety and all but one was literally blown to the floor about 1/2  
<br />
way through their flights for times ranging from 1:20 TO 1:30. The  
<br />
last one of the group was blasted sideways but somehow not down and  
<br />
got away with a nice 2:53, still somewhat less than it should have  
<br />
flown. The two schools going on to the Nationals are Mira Loma HS and  
<br />
Arden Middle School, both from Sacramento and repeats from last year  
<br />
(and schools that I work with).
<br />
<br />FYI , I happened to be in the scoring room when the appeals of the  
<br />
event were discussed by the three arbitrators. Interesting. They  
<br />
tried to reason out the effect of the AC but were obviously not  
<br />
airplane people. I &quot;volunteered&quot;  my explanations (arguments) of what  
<br />
I felt was incorrect reasoning.
<br />
First, most of the early flights were also poor  - read one good one  
<br />
(mentioned above) and the rest were &quot;5 second specials&quot;.
<br />
Second - How do you know that the later models would fly 3 minutes or  
<br />
so? - Because of experience I know what I'm  looking at.
<br />
Third - If the models are properly adjusted and trimmed they will fly  
<br />
alright - I explained that any air movement upsets the models and a  
<br />
big AC is a total &quot;potluck&quot; disaster with no control whatsoever.  
<br />
Blowing into the floor has nothing to do with trimming.
<br />
In the end, they let the event stand as I guess they felt some points  
<br />
for the schools are better than no points at all and there wasn't  
<br />
much they could do anyway about the situation.
<br />
They did seem to accept my explanations and hopefully next year the  
<br />
AC will be off!

<br />Also, does anybody out there have a source for .003 Boron?
