Thanks all for the advice.
<br />
<br />I ended up determining the best estimate for the CG by mounting the 
<br />
prop, putting on a 2.0 gram rubber motor and taping the wing posts 
<br />
to the side of the motor stick (MS) but without flying, just 
<br />
balancing the plane on a thread.
<br />
<br />I rolled some wing post sockets, then determined the drill size that 
<br />
would make the right size mounting hole.  I tested the drill on some 
<br />
similar balsa and determined it was sharp enough to cut through 
<br />
without splitting.
<br />
<br />I then made a drill jig with two inch long diameter brass tubes to 
<br />
guide the drill.  The tubes were held between two 1/16 inch balsa 
<br />
sheets glued to opposite sides of a balsa frame. The tubes were 
<br />
spaced apart the proper chord dimension to match up with the wing 
<br />
posts. The drill fit snugly in each tube without slop but could be 
<br />
easily twisted.   
<br />
<br />The drill jig had legs to grip opposite sides of the rolled MS 
<br />
without damaging the same.  I taped the jig to the MS after 
<br />
alignment to ensure it would not rotate.
<br />
<br />I then hand twirled the drill bit in each tube, and was able to 
<br />
neatly cut through the MS. I held a piece of scrap balsa against the 
<br />
bottom of the MS to ensure a clean lower hole with no break out or 
<br />
cracking. When the drill jig was removed I had two aligned, 
<br />
diametrically extending holes with no damage to the MS.  This was 
<br />
nice since it took me a few hours to make my first rolled MS.  
<br />
<br />It was then easy to glue the sockets in the MS with Duco cut 50% 
<br />
with acetone. The wing posts slid into the sockets just fine.  I 
<br />
then put some wash in on the inboard TE of the wing. 
<br />
<br />I will see how my guess on the CG location works tomorrow when I fly 
<br />
the plane for the first time.
<br />
<br />This is pretty basic stuff for you F1D guys, but may help anyone 
<br />
just making their first indoor plane with a rolled MS.  
<br />
<br />I did come in .4 grams below my target weight for the plane, and 
<br />
this was made possible by use of the rolled MS.  This allowed me to 
<br />
use really hard wing posts.  I hate it when those things break.
