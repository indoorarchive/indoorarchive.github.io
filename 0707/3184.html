<br />
The program operates on a two calendar-year cycle ending with the
<br />
Team Finals. A flyer may enter the program at any time during the
<br />
cycle by entering one or more &quot;Regional&quot; contests.
<br />
<br />The notion of a Regional is a holdover from a time when there were
<br />
too many F1d flyers and some method was was needed to winnow down the
<br />
field before the Team Finals. That led to a requirement that all
<br />
qualifiers must obtain 75+ regional points to fly in the Finals. At
<br />
one time there were also &quot;Local&quot; qualifying contests (10 point scale)
<br />
which were factored into this system, but these were eliminated in
<br />
the early 1980's.
<br />
<br />The purpose of the points system was to identify F1d flyers who were
<br />
consistently superior, i.e., in more than one contest. And it may
<br />
have been intended to normalize results from various geographic
<br />
areas, so that flyers who had consistent access to the best sites
<br />
didn't have an automatic advantage over those with access to, say,
<br />
only a Cat. II site.
<br />
<br />The rationale seemed to be a desire to avoid a situation in which a
<br />
flyer did really well at only one contest, the Team Finals, and who
<br />
would then make the team in place of a flyer with a more consistent
<br />
record. The points system was controversial in the 70's and early
<br />
80's.
<br />
<br />For example, from memory, in the 1971 program, I believe there were
<br />
53 flyers who qualified by obtaining 75 regional points plus local
<br />
points. That implies that there were more than 53 F1d flyers who
<br />
participated in the cycle. Probably only half of them attended the
<br />
Finals, but this provides a comparison to today when we had 23 flyers
<br />
qualify and 14 actually compete in the Finals.
<br />
<br />As participation has declined the idea of eliminating the Regional
<br />
requirement has been raised, but the consensus seems to be that
<br />
requiring program participants to fly in at least one Regional
<br />
stimulates contest activity.
