&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems everyone likes to talk about variable diameter props (VD) 
<br />
but hardly anyone does anything about it, excepting Jim Richmond, of 
<br />
course.  I was inspired to try my hand at VD after seeing JR put up a 
<br />
casual test flight of 33 minutes at Kibbie Dome Annual 2005. That 
<br />
flight only got to about 100 ft high, which appealed to me.  The 
<br />
first day of Team Finals 2007 I started out with a variable pitch (VP)
<br />
for a first flight of 32:47.  But I knew I needed to find another 90 
<br />
seconds somewhere to stay in the hunt, so after round 2 I decided to 
<br />
try my just-finished-never-flown VD prop.  Because I seemed to make 
<br />
slow, steady progress in adjustments in getting it to work, I 
<br />
unfortunately squandered the next two days of Team Finals, 
<br />
essentially just test flying, with too-slow improvements to show.  
<br />
But the excitement of getting the occasional &quot;good fold&quot; kept me 
<br />
committed to keep trying past a point when I should have gone back to 
<br />
tweaking the VPs instead.  Half my problem was also high torque 
<br />
launch problems--stalls at anything over .39 in-oz.  Eventually 
<br />
solved that (thanks, Tim Chang) and finally the VD seemed promising.  
<br />
But only after TFs were over, I got a &quot;Kibbie Dome Annual&quot; official 
<br />
time of 31:27 with the VD, climbing about 110 feet high, folding at 
<br />
13 minutes, and using all turns in a 9&quot; motor.  That flight is still 
<br />
begging me to continue with the VD concept, and so I shall.  VD will 
<br />
not make a good flyer out of a mediocre flyer, but I think it offers 
<br />
potential at least as good as VPs.
<br />
<br />One modeler asked if I had any advice for the those wishing to try 
<br />
build a VD.  Yes.  Don't suppose you will master it the first day  at 
<br />
an important contest!  Seems at every big contest I keep relearning 
<br />
the lesson, &quot;Stick to what you know when it really counts.&quot;   
<br />
Hopefully next time I will know, not merely believe that VDs work 
<br />
well. (Anyone here is free to email me for any other VD details, as 
<br />
far as I know them.) 
<br />
<br />Congratulations to Jim Richmond, John Kagan, Doug Shaefer, who will 
<br />
represent the USA very well at Belgrade, 2008, as also will the Jr. 
<br />
team--Tim Chang, Molly Neering, and Ethan Aaron.
